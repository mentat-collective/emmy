# emmy/clerk template

This directory contains a [`deps-new`][deps-new-url] template that creates a new
[Emmy][emmy-url] project with everything described in the ["Emmy via
Clerk"](https://emmy.mentat.org/#emmy-via-clerk) section of the [`Emmy`
documentation notebook][emmy-url] already configured.

To use the template, install the [`deps-new`][deps-new-url] tool:

```sh
clojure -Ttools install io.github.seancorfield/deps-new '{:git/tag "v0.5.0"}' :as new
```

Then create a project using the `emmy/clerk` template:

```
clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {io.github.mentat-collective/emmy {:git/sha "a6a79daebb82f95a7239e5ad0e8477ac8a27e539"}}}' \
-Tnew create \
:template emmy/clerk \
:name myusername/my-emmy-project
```

> **Note**
> The `:name` argument should match the GitHub slug (ie,
> `org_name/project_name`) where you expect to host the project. The above
> command will create a new project in the folder `my-emmy-project` in the
> directory where you run the command.
>
> To use a different version of the template, delete the `:git/tag` entry and
> replace the `:git/sha` above with the long-form SHA of version you need from
> the [Emmy commit
> history](https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/commits/main).

The generated project will contains more guides and information in its
`README.md` and in the generated Clerk notebook.

## Template Keyword Options

You can customize the `emmy/clerk` template by supplying any of the following
key-value pairs to the above command (See [`template.edn`][template-edn-url] for
default values):

- `:description`: This string is inserted at the top of your generated project's
  README.md.
- `:emmy-version`: version of [`Emmy` from Clojars][clojars-url]. See the
  [Clojars page][clojars-url] for version choices.
- `:clerk-port`: the port used by `clerk/serve!` during interactive development.
- `:clerk-sha`: the hash of the Clerk version you'd like to use in the template.
  (`clerk-utils/custom` uses a [git
  dependency](https://clojure.org/news/2018/01/05/git-deps) for Clerk.)
- `:shadow-port`: the port that [`shadow-cljs`][shadow-url] uses to serve
  compiled JavaScript during interactive development.
- `:shadow-version`: the version of [`shadow-cljs`][shadow-url] required by the
  generated project.
- `:clj-version`: the version of Clojure required by the generated project.
- `:cljs-version`: the version of ClojureScript required by the generated
  project. (_note that this needs to meet or exceed the version declared in the
  [`shadow-cljs` `deps.edn`
  file](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs/blob/master/deps.edn) for the
  `shadow-cljs` version you've chosen._)
- `:http-server-port`: The port used by `bb serve` and `bb publish-local` to
  serve the local statically built site.
- `:cname`: If you're serving your GitHub Pages build from a custom URL, pass
  the value (like `"emmy.mentat.org"`) of the custom site via this argument.
