== ODE Initial Value Problems

Initial-value problems for ordinary differential equations can be attacked by a
great many specialized methods. Numerical analysts agree that there is no best
method. Each has situations where it works best and other situations where it
fails or is not very good. Also, each technique has numerous parameters, options
and defaults.

The default integration method is Bulirsch-Stoer. Usually, the Bulirsch-Stoer
algorithm will give better and faster results than others, but there are
applications where a quality-controlled trapezoidal method or a
quality-controlled 4th order Runge-Kutta method is appropriate. The algorithm
used can be set by the user:

[source, clojure]

(set-ode-integration-method! 'qcrk4)
(set-ode-integration-method! 'bulirsch-stoer)
(set-ode-integration-method! 'qcctrap2)
(set-ode-integration-method! 'explicit-gear)

WARNING: In Emmy we currently only support the Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer
algorithm. If you need any of the others, please
https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/pulls[file a PR] and we can
discuss how to get these in for you.

The integration methods all automatically select the step sizes to maintain the
error tolerances. But if we have an exceptionally stiff system, or a bad
discontinuity, for most integrators the step size will go down to zero and the
integrator will make no progress. If you encounter such a disaster try
`explicit-gear`.

We have programs that implement other methods of integration, such as an
implicit version of Gear's stiff solver, and we have a whole language for
describing error control, but these features are not available through this
interface.

The two main interfaces are `evolve` and `state-advancer`.

The procedure `state-advancer` is used to advance the state of a system
according to a system of first order ordinary differential equations for a
specified interval of the independent variable. The state may have arbitrary
structure, however we require that the first component of the state is the
independent variable.

The procedure `evolve` uses `state-advancer` to repeatedly advance the state of
the system by a specified interval, examining aspects of the state as the
evolution proceeds.

In the following descriptions we assume that `sysder` is a user provided
procedure that gives the parametric system derivative. The parametric system
derivative takes parameters, such as a mass or length, and produces a procedure
that takes a state and returns the derivative of the state. Thus, the system
derivative takes arguments in the following way:

[source, clojure]
----
((sysder parameter-1 ... parameter-n) state)
----

There may be no parameters, but then the system derivative procedure must still
be called with no arguments to produce the procedure that takes states to the
derivative of the state.

For example, if we have the differential equations for an ellipse centered on
the origin and aligned with the coordinate axes:

    Dx(t) = -a y(t)
    Dy(t) = +b x(t)

We can make a parametric system derivative for this system as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn ellipse-sysder [a b]
  (fn [[t x y]]
    (up 1				   ;; dt/dt
        (* -1 a y) ;; dx/dt
        (* b x)))) ;; dy/dt
----

The procedure `evolve` is invoked as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
((evolve sysder . parameters)
 initial-state dt final-t optional-opts)
----

The user can pass a procedure via the keyword `:observe` in `optional-opts` that
takes the state as an argument.

The `:observe` fn is passed successive states of the system as the evolution
proceeds. For example it might be used to print the state or to plot some
interesting function of the state.

The interval between calls to the monitor is the argument `dt`. The evolution
stops when the independent variable is larger than `final-t`. The optional
keyword argument parameter `:epsilon` specifies the allowable error.

For example, we can evolve our state forward for 10 seconds:

[source, clojure]
----
((evolve ellipse-sysder 0.5 2.0)
 (up 0. .5 .5)	;; initial state
 0.01           ;; step size
 10.0)          ;; final value of t
;;=> (up 9.99999999999992 -0.2835304866702712 -0.9635568769766077)
----

To take more control of the integration one may use the state advancer directly.

The procedure `state-advancer` is invoked as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
((state-advancer sysder . parameters) start-state dt optional-args)
----

The state advancer will give a new state resulting from evolving the start state
by the increment `dt` of the independent variable. The allowed local truncation
error is specified by the optional keyword argument `:epsilon`:

For example,

[source, clojure]
----
((state-advancer ellipse-sysder 0.5 2.0)
  (up 0 0.5 0.5) 3.0 {:epsilon 1e-10})
;;=> (up 2.999999999999995 -0.530276250315008 -0.35387624023977055)
----

For a more complex example that shows the use of substructure in the state,
consider the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn harmonic-sysder [m k]
  (fn [state]
    (let [[x y]   (coordinate state)
          [px py] (momentum state)]
      (up 1                                ;; dt/dt
          (up (/ px m) (/ py m))           ;; dq/dt
          (down (* -1 k x) (* -1 k y)))))) ;; dp/dt
----

We could monitor the energy (the Hamiltonian):

[source, clojure]
----
(defn H [m k]
  (fn [state]
    (+ (/ (square (momentum state))
          (* 2 m))
       (* (/ 1 2) k
          (square (coordinate state))))))

(let [initial-state (up 0
                        (up 0.5 0.5)
                        (down 0.1 0.0))
      monitor (fn [_ state]
                (println
                 (state->t state)
                 "\t"
                 ((H m k) state)))
      step-size 1.0
      final-time 10
      m 0.5
      k 2.0]
  ((evolve harmonic-sysder m k)
   initial-state
   step-size
   final-time
   {:observe monitor}))

== Constants

There are a few constants that we find useful, and are thus provided in
Emmy.

[source, clojure]
----
(def pi (* 4 (atan 1 1)))
(def -pi (- pi))
----

For numerical analysis, we provide the smallest number that when added to `1.0`
makes a difference:

[source, clojure]
----
(def machine-epsilon
  (loop [e 1.0]
    (if (= 1.0 (+ e 1.0))
      (* e 2.0)
      (recur (/ e 2.0)))))

(def sqrt-machine-epsilon
  (Math/sqrt machine-epsilon))
