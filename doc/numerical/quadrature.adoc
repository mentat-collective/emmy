= Quadrature

== Quadrature

Quadrature is the process of computing definite integrals of functions. A
sugared default procedure for quadrature is provided, and we hope that it is
adequate for most purposes.

[source, clojure]
----
(definite-integral <integrand>
                   <lower-limit> <upper-limit>
                   {:compile? true})
----

The integrand must be a real-valued function of a real argument. The limits of
integration are specified as additional arguments.

Optionally you can supply a map of keyword arguments. The top level
`definite-integral` function uses the following three arguments:

* `*:compile?*` can be used to suppress compilation of the integrand, thus
  forcing it to be interpreted. This is usually to be ignored.
* `*:info?*`: If true, `definite-integral` will return a map of integration
  information returned by the underlying integrator. Else, returns an estimate
  of the definite integral.
* `*:method*`: Specifies the integration method used. Must be:
** a keyword naming one of the available methods in
   https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/blob/1aa81540a8109199ad111bde6ed5021624e62b73/src/emmy/numerical/quadrature.cljc#L65[`available-methods`]
** a function with the proper integrator signature
** a dictionary of integrator options with a `:method` key

`:method` defaults to `:open`, which specifies an adaptive bulirsch-stoer
quadrature method. The other allowed / supported methods are:

[source, clojure]
----
:open
:closed
:closed-open
:open-closed
:bulirsch-stoer-open
:bulirsch-stoer-closed
:adaptive-bulirsch-stoer
:left-riemann
:right-riemann
:lower-riemann
:upper-riemann
:midpoint
:trapezoid
:boole
:milne
:simpson
:simpson38
:romberg
:romberg-open
----

The quadrature methods are all based on extrapolation. The Romberg method is a
Richardson extrapolation of the trapezoid rule. It is usually worse than the
other methods, which are adaptive rational function extrapolations of Trapezoid
and Midpoint rules.

Closed integrators are best if we can include the endpoints of integration. This
cannot be done if the endpoint is singular: thus the open formulas. Also, open
formulas are forced when we have infinite limits.

Let's do an example, it is as easy as pi!

[source, clojure]
----
(defn witch [x]
  (/ 4.0 (+ 1.0 (* x x))))

(definite-integral witch 0.0 1.0
  {:method :romberg :tolerance 1e-12})
;; => 3.141592653589793
----

Here's another example for fun:

[source, clojure]
----
(defn foo [n]
  (let [f (fn [x] (expt (log (/ 1 x)) n))]
    (definite-integral
      f 0.0 1.0
      {:tolerance 1e-12
       :method :open-closed})))

(foo 0)
;;=> 1.0

(foo 1)
;;=> 0.9999999999983304

(foo 2)
;;=> 1.999999999998337

(foo 3)
;;=> 5.999999999998272

(foo 4)
;;=> 23.99999999949962

(foo 5)
;;=> 119.99999998778476
----

Do you recognize this function?  What is `(foo 6)`?
