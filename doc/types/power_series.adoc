= Power Series

== Power Series

Power series are often needed in mathematical computations. There are a few
primitive power series, and new power series can be formed by operations on
existing power series. If `<p>` is an expression denoting a power series, then:

[source, clojure]
----
(series/series? <any>)    ;;=> <boolean>
(kind <p>)                ;;=> :emmy.series/series
----

Series can be constructed in a variety of ways. If one has a procedure that
implements the general form of a coefficient then this gives the most direct
method:

For example, the `n`-th coefficient of the power series for the exponential
function is `1/n!`. We can write this as

[source, clojure]
----
(series/generate (fn [n] (/ 1 (factorial n))))
----

Sometimes we have a finite number of coefficients and we want to make a series
with those given coefficients (assuming zeros for all higher-order
coefficients). We can do this with the extensional constructor. Thus:

[source, clojure]
----
(series 1 2 3 4 5)
----

is the series whose first coefficients are the arguments given.

There are some nice initial series:

`*series/zero*`

is the series of all zero coefficients.

`*series/one*`

is the series of all zero coefficients except for the first (constant), which
is one.

`*(constant-series c)*`

is the series of all zero coefficients except for the first (constant), which is
the given constant.

`*((binomial-series a) x)*`

Returns a series containing the coefficients of the expansion of `(1+x)^a`.

In addition, we provide the following initial series:

[source, clojure]
----
exp-series, cos-series, sin-series, tan-series, sec-series,
asin-series, acos-series, atan-series, acot-series,
sinh-series, cosh-series, tanh-series, asinh-series, atanh-series,
log1+x-series, log1-x-series,
fib-series, catalan-series
----

Series can also be formed by processes such as exponentiation of an operator or
a square matrix.

For example, if `f` is any function of one argument, and if `x` and `dx` are
numerical expressions, then this expression denotes the Taylor expansion of f
around x.

[source, clojure]
----
(let [f (literal-function 'f)]
  (((exp (* 'dx D)) f) 'x))

;; (f x)
;; (* dx ((D f) x))
;; (* 1/2 (expt dx 2) (((expt D 2) f) x))
;; (* 1/6 (expt dx 3) (((expt D 3) f) x))
;; (* 1/24 (expt dx 4) (((expt D 4) f) x))
;; (* 1/120 (expt dx 5) (((expt D 5) f) x))
;; (* 1/720 (expt dx 6) (((expt D 6) f) x))
;; ...
----

We often want to show a few (`n`) terms of a series:

[source, clojure]
----
(seq:print <n> <p>)

;; pretty-printing version
(seq:pprint <n> <p>)
----

For example, to show eight coefficients of the cosine series we might write:

[source, clojure]
----
(seq:print 8 (((exp D) cos) 0))
;; 1.0
;; 0
;; -1/2
;; 0
;; 1/24
;; 0
;; -1/720
;; 0
----

We can make the sequence of partial sums of a series. The sequence is a stream,
not a series.

[source, clojure]
----
(seq:print 10 (partial-sums (((exp D) cos) 0.)))
1.
1.
.5

.5416666666666666
.5416666666666666
.5402777777777777
.5402777777777777
.5403025793650793
.5403025793650793
----

Note that the sequence of partial sums approaches `(cos 1)`.

[source, clojure]
----
(cos 1)
;;=> .5403023058681398
----

In addition to the special operations for series, the following generic
operations are defined for series:

[source, clojure]
----
negate, invert, +, -, *, /, expt
----

NOTE: `emmy.series` has many more operations than this that aren't
registered in the generic system. See the
https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/blob/main/src/emmy/series.cljc[`emmy.series`]
namespace for a Literate Programming-style exposition of the capabilities
Emmy affords for series and power series.
