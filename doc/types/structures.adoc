== Structured Objects

Emmy supports a variety of structured object types, such as

* lists
* vectors
* up and down tuples
* matrices
* power series

The explicit constructor for a structured object is a procedure whose name is
what we call objects of that type. For example, we make explicit vectors with
the procedure named `vector`, and explicit lists with the procedure named
`list`. For example:

----
(list 1 2 3 4 5)  a list of the first five positive integers
[1 2 3 4 5]       a vector of the first five positive integers
(up 10 3 4)       an up tuple with three components
(down 10 3 4)     a down tuple with three components
----

There is no natural way to notate a matrix, except by giving its rows (or
columns). To make a matrix with three rows and five columns:

[source, clojure]
----
(def M
  (matrix-by-rows [1  2  3  4  5]
                  [6  7  8  9 10]
                  [11 12 13 14 15]))
----

A power series may be constructed from an explicit set of coefficients. For
example:

[source, clojure]
----
(power-series 1 2 3 4 5)
----

is the power series whose first five coefficients are the first five positive
integers and all of the rest of the coefficients are zero.

Although each datatype has its own specialized procedures, there are a variety
of generic procedures for selecting the components from structured objects. To
get the `n`-th component from a linear data structure, `v`, such as a vector or
a list, one may in general use the generic selector, `ref` (or `nth`, the native
Clojure operation that we recommend you prefer):

----
(ref x n)
----

NOTE: `ref` is the name of this procedure in the original `scmutils`, so we
alias it into `emmy.env` for compatibility. In Clojure, a `ref` is a
https://clojure.org/reference/refs[transactional reference], used for safe,
shared mutable state. [[emmy.env/ref]] will attempt to act like the native
Clojure `nth` with one argument, or `get-in` for multiple arguments, and fall
back to [[clojure.core/ref]] if it's not successful. You should become
comfortable with [[clojure.core/nth]] and [[clojure.core/get-in]] and switch to
those.

All structured objects are accessed by zero-based indexing, as is the custom in
Clojure programs and in relativity. For example, to get the third element (index
`= 2`) of a vector or a list we can use:

[source, clojure]
----
;; either works for a vector, which is associative:
(get [1 2 3 4 5 2] 2)      ;; = 3
(ref [1 2 3 4 5 2] 2)      ;; = 3

;; Lists are not associative, so we need `nth`:
(nth (list 1 2 3 4 5 2) 2) ;; = 3
----

If `M` is a matrix, then the component in the `i`-th row and `j`-th column can
be obtained by `(ref M i j)` (or `(get-in M [i j])`. For the matrix given above:

[source, clojure]
----
(ref M 1 3)      ;; = 9
(get-in M [1 3]) ;; = 9
----

Other structured objects are more magical:

[source, clojure]
----
(ref cos-series 6)         = -1/720
----

The magic is due to Clojure's beautiful
https://clojure.org/reference/sequences[Sequence API]. All native collections
can be turned into generic sequences. Emmy containers all implement this
interface, and respond appropriately to `seq`.

The number of components of a structured object can be found with the `count`
function:

[source, clojure]
----
(count [1 2 3 4 5]) = 5
----

Besides the extensional constructors, most structured-object datatypes can be
intentionally constructed by giving a procedure whose values are the components
of the object. These `generate` procedures are:

[source, clojure]
----
(vector:generate  n   proc)
(m:generate       m n proc)
(s:generate           proc)
----

For example, one may make a 6 component vector each of whose components is `pi`
times the index of that component, as follows:

[source, clojure]
----
(vector:generate 6 (fn [i] (* pi i)))
----

Or a `3x5` matrix whose components are

* the sum of `pi` times the row number
* `6` times the column number:

[source, clojure]
----
(m:generate 3 5 (fn [i j] (+ (* pi i) (* 6 j))))
----

Also, it is commonly useful to deal with a structured object in an elementwise
fashion. We provide special combinators for many structured datatypes that allow
one to make a new structure, of the same type and size of the given ones, where
the components of the new structure are the result of applying the given
procedure to the corresponding components of the given structures.

[source, clojure]
----
((vector:elementwise proc) <v1> ... <vn>)
((structure:elementwise proc) <s1> ... <sn>)
((matrix:elementwise proc) <M1> ... <Mn>)
((series:elementwise proc) <p1> ... <pn>)
----

Thus, vector addition is equivalent to `(vector:elementwise +)`.

CAUTION: These do not yet work! If you need any of these, please feel free to
file an issue https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/pulls[here].

== Clojure Vectors

We identify the Clojure vector data type with mathematical `n`-dimensional vectors.
These are interpreted as up tuples when a distinction between up tuples and down
tuples is made.

We inherit from Clojure the `vector` constructor, as well as the literal `[x y
z]` form of construction. Select elements with `nth`. `count` returns the length
of a vector. We also get the type predicate `vector?`.

In the documentation that follows, `<v>` will stand for a vector-valued
expression. Operations on vectors typically return an `up` structure, which is
equivalent but explicit about its variance.

[source, clojure]
----
(vector? <any>)           ;;=> <boolean>
(kind <v>)                ;;=> clojure.lang.PersistentVector

(exact? <v>).             ;;=> <boolean>
     Is true if any component of <v> is inexact, otherwise it is false.

(count <v>)               ;;=> <+integer>
     gets the number of components of <v>

(nth <v> <i>)
     gets the <i>th (zero-based) component of vector <v>

(get-in <v> [<i> <j> ,,,])
     gets the <j>th element of the <i>th (zero-based) component of vector <v>

(vector:generate <n> <procedure>)
     generates an <n>-dimensional vector whose <i>th component is the
     result of the application of the <procedure> to the number <i>.

(zero-like <v>)           ;;=> <vector>
     Gives the zero vector of the dimension of vector <v>.

(zero? <v>)               ;;=> <boolean>
(negate <v>)              ;;=> <up>

(conjugate <v>)           ;;=> <vector>
     Elementwise complex-conjugate of <v>
----

Simple arithmetic on vectors is componentwise:

[source, clojure]
----
(= <v1> <v2> ...)         ;;=> <boolean>
(+ <v1> <v2> ...)         ;;=> <up>
(- <v1> <v2> ...)         ;;=> <up>
----

There are a variety of products defined on vectors.

[source, clojure]
----
(dot-product   <v1> <v2>)    ;;=> <x>
(inner-product <v1> <v2>)    ;;=> <x>
(cross-product <v1> <v2>)
----

Cross product only makes sense for 3-dimensional vectors.

[source, clojure]
----
(* <x> <v>)    =  (scalar*vector <x> <v>)       ;;=> <up>
(* <v> <x>)    =  (vector*scalar <v> <x>)       ;;=> <up>
(/ <v> <x>)    =  (vector*scalar <v> (/ 1 <x>)) ;;=> <up>
----

The product of two vectors makes an outer product structure:

[source, clojure]
----
(* <v> <v>)    =  (outer-product <v> <v>) ;;=> <structure>
----

[source, clojure]
----
(abs <v>) = (sqrt (dot-product <v> <v>))

(inner-product <v1> <v2>) = (dot-product (conjugate <v1>) <v2>)
(magnitude <v>)      = (complex-norm <v>)
----

`*(v:make-basis-unit <n> <i>)*`

Makes the `n`-dimensional basis unit vector with zero in all components except
for the `i`-th component, which is one.

WARNING: The following functions are referenced in the `scmutils` refman, but
don't yet exist in Emmy. Please
https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/pulls[file a ticket] if this is
something you need, or hang on until we get there.

[source, clojure]
----
(maxnorm <v>)

    Gives the maximum of the magnitudes of the components of `<v>`

(v:make-unit <v>)  =  (/ <v> (euclidean-norm <v>))
(v:unit? <v>)      =  (one? (euclidean-norm <v>))

(v:basis-unit? <v>)

    Is true if and only if <v> is a basis unit vector.
----

== Up Tuples and Down Tuples

Sometimes it is advantageous to distinguish down tuples and up tuples. If the
elements of up tuples are interpreted to be the components of vectors in a
particular coordinate system, the elements of the down tuples may be thought of
as the components of the dual vectors in that coordinate system. The union of
the up tuple and the down tuple data types is the data type we call
"structures."

Structures may be recursive and they need not be uniform. Thus it is possible to
have an up structure with three components: the first is a number, the second is
an up structure with two numerical components, and the third is a down structure
with two numerical components. Such a structure has size (or length) 3, but it
has five dimensions.

In Emmy, Clojure vectors are interpreted as up tuples, and the down tuples
are distinguished. The predicate `structure?` is true of any down or up tuple,
but the two can be distinguished by the predicates `up?` and `down?`.

[source, clojure]
----
(up?    <any>) ;;=> <boolean>
(down?  <any>) ;;=> <boolean>

(structure? <any>) = (or (down? <any>) (up? <any>))
----

In the following, `<s>` stands for any structure-valued expression; `<up>` and
`<down>` will be used if necessary to make the distinction.

The generic `kind` operation distinguishes the types:

[source, clojure]
----
(kind <s>) ;; => :emmy.structure/up or :emmy.structure/down
----

We reserve the right to change this implementation to distinguish Clojure
vectors from up tuples. Thus, we provide (identity) conversions between vectors
and up tuples.

[source, clojure]
----
(vector->up <vector>)    ;;=> <up>
(vector->down <vector>)  ;;=> <down>

(structure->vector <structure>) ;;=> <clojure-vector>
----

Constructors are provided for these types, analogous to `list` and `vector`:

[source, clojure]
----
(up . args)      ;;=> <up>
(down . args)    ;;=> <down>
----

The dimension of a structure is the number of entries, adding up the numbers of
entries from substructures. The dimension of any structure can be determined by

[source, clojure]
----
(dimension <s>)       ;;=> <+integer>
----

Processes that need to traverse a structure need to know the number of
components at the top level. This is the length of the structure:

[source, clojure]
----
(count <s>)         ;;=> <+integer>
----

The `i`-th component (zero-based) can be accessed by:

[source, clojure]
----
(ref <s> i)

;; Or, to use the preferred native `get`:
(get <s> i)
----

For example:

[source, clojure]
----
(ref (up 3 (up 5 6) (down 2 4)) 1)
;; (up 5 6)
----

As usual, the generic `ref` procedure or the native `get-in` can recursively
access substructure:

[source, clojure]
----
(get-in (up 3 (up 5 6) (down 2 4)) [1 0])
;; => 5

(ref (up 3 (up 5 6) (down 2 4)) 1 0)
;; => 5
----

Given a structure `<s>` we can make a new structure of the same type with `<x>`
substituted for the `<n>`-th component of the given structure using `assoc`:

[source, clojure]
----
(assoc <s> <n> <x>)
----

We can construct an entirely new structure of length `<n>` whose components are
the values of a procedure using `s:generate`:

[source, clojure]
----
(s:generate <n> <up/down> <procedure>)
----

The `up/down` argument may be either `::structure/up` or `::structure/down`.

The following generic arithmetic operations are defined for structures.


`*(zero? <s>) ;;=> <boolean>*`

is true if all of the components of the structure are zero.

`*(zero-like <s>) ;;=> <s>*`

produces a new structure with the same shape as the given structure but with all
components being zero-like the corresponding component in the given structure.

[source, clojure]
----
(negate <s>)    ;;=> <s>
(magnitude <s>) ;;=> <s>
(abs <s>)       ;;=> <s>
(conjugate <s>) ;;=> <s>
----

produce new structures which are the result of applying the generic procedure
elementwise to the given structure.

[source, clojure]
----
(= <s1> ... <sn>) ;;=> <boolean>
----

is true only when the corresponding components are `=`.

[source, clojure]
----
(+ <s1> ... <sn>) ;;=> <s>
(- <s1> ... <sn>) ;;=> <s>
----

These are componentwise addition and subtraction.

----
(* <s1> <s2>) ;;=> <s> or <x> , a structure or a number
----

magically does what you want: If the structures are compatible for contraction
the product is the contraction (the sum of the products of the corresponding
components.) If the structures are not compatible for contraction the product is
the structure of the shape and length of `<s2>` whose components are the
products of `<s1>` with the corresponding components of `<s2>`.

Structures are compatible for contraction if they are of the same length, of
opposite type, and if their corresponding elements are compatible for
contraction (or if either paired-up element is not a structure).

It is not obvious why this is what you want, but try it, you'll like it!

For example, the following are compatible for contraction:

[source, clojure]
----
(* (up (up 2 3) (down 5 7 11))
   (down (down 13 17) (up 19 23 29)))
;;=> 652
----

Two up tuples are not compatible for contraction. Their product is an outer
product:

[source, clojure]
----
(* (up 2 3) (up 5 7 11))
;; (up (up 10 15) (up 14 21) (up 22 33))

(* (up 5 7 11) (up 2 3))
;; (up (up 10 14 22) (up 15 21 33))
----

This product is not generally associative or commutative. It is commutative for
structures that contract, and it is associative for structures that represent
linear transformations.

To yield additional flavor, the definition of `square` for structures is
inconsistent with the definition of product. (It's defined as the `dot-product`
of the structures.)

It is possible to square an up tuple or a down tuple. The result is the sum of
the squares of the components. This makes it convenient to write such things as
`(/ (square p) (* 2 m))`, but it is sometimes confusing.

Some structures, such as the ones that represent inertia tensors, must be
inverted. (The `m` above may be an inertia tensor!)

Division is arranged to make this work, when possible. The details are too hairy
to explain in this short document. We probably need to write a book about this!

refman, not us!
