;; Lagrange's interpolating polynomial is straightforward, but not terribly
;; efficient; every time we change `points` or `x` we have to redo the entire
;; calculation. Ideally we'd like to be able to perform:
;;
;; 1. Some computation on `points` that would let us efficiently evaluate the
;;    fitted polynomial for different values of `x` in O(n) time, or
;;
;; 2. A computation on a particular `x` that would let us efficiently add new
;;    points to the set we use to generate the interpolating polynomial.
;;
;; "Neville's algorithm" lets us generate the same interpolating polynomial
;; recursively. By flipping the recursion around and generating values from the
;; bottom up, we can achieve goal #2 and add new points incrementally.
;;
;; ## Neville's Algorithm
;;
;; Start the recursion with a single point. Any point $(x, f(x))$ has a unique
;; 0th order polynomial passing through it - the constant function $P(x) = f(x)$.
;; For points $x_a$, $x_b$, let's call this $P_a$, $P_b$, etc.
;;
;; $P_{ab}$ is the unique FIRST order polynomial (ie, a line) going through
;; points $x_a$ and $x_b$.
;;
;; this first recursive step gives us this rule:
;;
;; $$P_{ab}(x) = [(x - x_b) P_a(x) - (x - x_a) P_b(x)] / [x_a - x_b]$$
;;
;; For higher order terms like $P_{abcd}$, let's call $P_{abc}$ 'P_l', and
;; $P_{bcd}$ 'P_r' (the polynomial fitted through the left and right set of
;; points).
;;
;; Similarly, the left and rightmost inputs - $x_a$ and $x_b$ - will be $x_l$
;; and $x_r$.
;;
;; Neville's algorithm states that:
;;
;; $$P(x) = [(x - x_r) P_l(x) - (x - x_l) P_r(x)] / [x_l - x_r]$$
;;
;; This recurrence works because the two parents $P_l$ and $P_r$ already agree
;; at all points except $x_l$ and $x_r$.

(defn neville-recursive
  "Top-down implementation of [Neville's

;; ## Tableau-based Methods

;; Neville's algorithm generates each new polynomial from $P_l$ and $P_r$, using
;; this recursion to incorporate the full set of points.
;;
;; You can write these out these relationships in a "tableau" that grows to the
;; right from an initial left column:
;;
;;```
;; p0
;;  \
;;  p01
;;  /  \
;; p1  p012
;;  \  /  \
;; p12   p0123
;;  /  \  /  \
;; p2  p123   p01234
;;  \  /  \  /
;; p23   p1234
;;  /  \  /
;; p3  p234
;;  \  /
;;  p34
;;  /
;; p4
;;```

;; The next few functions will discuss "rows" and "columns" of the tableau. That
;; refers to the rows and columns of this representation;
;;
;; p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
;; p1 p12 p123 p1234 .
;; p2 p23 p234 .     .
;; p3 p34 .    .     .
;; p4 .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;;
;; The first column here is the initial set of points. Each entry in each
;; successive column is generated through some operation between the entry to
;; its left, and the entry one left and one down.
;;
;; Look again at Neville's algorithm:
;;
;; $$P(x) = [(x - x_r) P_l(x) - (x - x_l) P_r(x)] / [x_l - x_r]$$
;;
;; $l$ refers to the entry in the same row, previous column, while $r$ is one
;; row lower, previous column.
;;
;; If each cell in the above tableau tracked:
;;
;; - the value of P(x) for the cell
;; - $x_l$, the x value of the leftmost point incorporated so far
;; - $x_r$, the right point
;;
;; we could build up Neville's rule incrementally. Let's attempt to build a
;; function of this signature:

(comment
  (defn _neville-incremental
    "Takes a potentially lazy sequence of `points` and a point `x` and generates a
  lazy sequence of approximations of P(x).

  entry `N` in the returned sequence is the estimate using a polynomial
  generated from the first `N` points of the input sequence."
    [_points _x]))
;;
;; First, write a function to process each initial point into a vector that
;; contains each of those required elements:

(defn- neville-prepare
  "Processes each point of the form `[x, (f x)]` into:

  ```
  $$[x_l, x_r, p]$$
  ```

  where $p$ is the polynomial that spans all points from $l$ to $r$. The
  recursion starts with $p = f(x)$.
  "
  [[x fx]]
  [x x fx])

;; Next, a function that generates the next entry, given l and r:

(defn- neville-combine-fn
  "Given some value $x$, returns a function that combines $l$ and $r$ entries in
  the tableau, arranged like this:

  ```
  l -- return
     /
    /
   /
  r
  ```

  generates the `return` entry of the form

  $$[x_l, x_r, p]$$."
  [x]
  (fn [[xl _ pl] [_ xr pr]]
    (let [plr (g// (g/+ (g/* (g/- x xr) pl)
                        (g/* (g/- xl x) pr))
                   (g/- xl xr))]
      [xl xr plr])))

;; We can use higher-order functions to turn this function into a NEW function
;; that can transform an entire column:

(defn- neville-next-column
  "This function takes some point $x$, and returns a new function that takes some
  column in the tableau and generates the next column."
  [x]
  (fn [prev-column]
    (map (neville-combine-fn x)
         prev-column
         (rest prev-column))))

;; `neville-tableau` will generate the entire tableau:

(defn- neville-tableau [points x]
  (->> (map neville-prepare points)
       (iterate (neville-next-column x))
       (take-while seq)))

;; Really, we're only interested in the first row:
;;
;; p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
;;
;; So define a function to grab that:

(defn ^:no-doc first-terms [tableau]
  (map first tableau))

;; the final piece we need is a function that will extract the estimate from our
;; row of $[x_l, x_r, p]$ vectors:

(defn- neville-present [row]
  (map peek row))

;; Putting it all together:

(defn neville-incremental
  "Takes a potentially lazy sequence of `points` and a point `x` and generates a
  lazy sequence of approximations of P(x).

  entry N in the returned sequence is the estimate using a polynomial generated
  from the first N points of the input sequence."
  [points x]
  (neville-present
   (first-terms
    (neville-tableau points x))))

;; How do we know this works? We can prove it by using generic arithmetic to
;; compare the full symbolic lagrange polynomial to each entry in the successive
;; approximation.

(comment
  (defn lagrange-incremental
    "Generates a sequence of estimates of `x` to polynomials fitted to `points`;
  each entry uses one more point, just like [[neville-incremental]]."
    [points x]
    (let [n (count points)]
      (map (fn [i]
             (lagrange (take i points) x))
           (range 1 (inc n)))))

  ;; Every point is the same!
  (let [points [['x_1 'y_1] ['x_2 'y_2] ['x_3 'y_3] ['x_4 'y_4]]
        diffs  (map (fn [neville lagrange]
                      (g/simplify
                       (g/- neville lagrange)))
                    (neville-incremental points 'x)
                    (lagrange-incremental points 'x))]
    (every? zero? diffs))
  ;; => true
  )

;; ## Generic Tableau Processing
;;
;; The above pattern, of processing tableau entries, is general enough that we
;; can abstract it out into a higher order function that takes a `prepare` and
;; `merge` function and generates a tableau. Any method generating a tableau can
;; use a `present` function to extract the first row, OR to process the tableau
;; in any other way that they like.
;;
;; This is necessarily more abstract! But we'll specialize it shortly, and
;; rebuild `neville-incremental` into its final form.
;;
;; I'm keeping `points` in the argument vector for now, vs returning a new
;; function; if you want to do this yourself, curry the function with `(partial
;; tableau-fn prepare merge present)`.

(defn tableau-fn
  "Returns a Newton-style approximation tableau, given:

  - `prepare`: a fn that processes each element of the supplied `points` into
  the state necessary to calculate future tableau entries.

  - `merge`: a fn of `l`and `r` the tableau entries:

  ```
  l -- return
     /
    /
   /
  r
  ```

  the inputs are of the same form returned by `prepare`. `merge` should return a
  new structure of the same form.

  - `points`: the (potentially lazy) sequence of points used to generate the
  first column of the tableau.
  "
  [prepare merge points]
  (let [next-col (fn [previous-col]
                   (map merge
                        previous-col
                        (rest previous-col)))]
    (->> (map prepare points)
         (iterate next-col)
         (take-while seq))))

;; Redefine `neville-merge` to make it slightly more efficient, with baked-in
;; native operations:

(defn- neville-merge
  "Returns a tableau merge function. Identical to [[neville-combine-fn]] but uses
  native operations instead of generic operations."
  [x]
  (fn [[xl _ pl] [_ xr pr]]
    (let [p (/ (+ (* (- x xr) pl)
                  (* (- xl x) pr))
               (- xl xr))]
      [xl xr p])))

;; And now, [[neville]], identical to [[neville-incremental]] except using the
;; generic tableau generator.
;;
;; The form of the tableau also makes it easy to select a particular /column/
;; instead of just the first row. Columns are powerful because they allow you to
;; successively interpolate between pairs, triplets etc of points, instead of
;; moving onto very high order polynomials.
;;
;; I'm not sure it's the best interface, but we'll add that arity here.

(defn neville
  "Takes:

  - a (potentially lazy) sequence of `points` of the form `[x (f x)]` and
  - a point `x` to interpolate

  and generates a lazy sequence of approximations of `P(x)`. Each entry in the
  return sequence incorporates one more point from `points` into the `P(x)`
  estimate.

  Said another way: the Nth in the returned sequence is the estimate using a
  polynomial generated from the first `N` points of the input sequence:

  ```
  p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
  ```

  This function generates each estimate using Neville's algorithm:

  ```
  $$P(x) = [(x - x_r) P_l(x) - (x - x_l) P_r(x)] / [x_l - x_r]$$
  ```

  ### Column

  If you supply an integer for the third `column` argument, `neville` will
  return that /column/ of the interpolation tableau instead of the first row.
  This will give you a sequence of nth-order polynomial approximations taken
  between point `i` and the next `n` points.

  As a reminder, this is the shape of the tableau:

  ```
   p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
   p1 p12 p123 p1234 .
   p2 p23 p234 .     .
   p3 p34 .    .     .
   p4 .   .    .     .
  ```

  So supplying a `column` of `1` gives a sequence of linear approximations
  between pairs of points; `2` gives quadratic approximations between successive
  triplets, etc.

;; ## Modified Neville
;;
;; Press's Numerical Recipes, chapter 3 (p103) (
;; http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f3-1.pdf ) describes a modified
;; version of Neville's algorithm that is slightly more efficient than the
;; version above.
;;
;; Allan Macleod, in "A comparison of algorithms for polynomial interpolation",
;; discusses this variation under the name "Modified Neville".

;; By generating the /delta/ from each previous estimate in the tableau,
;; Modified Neville is able to swap one of the multiplications above for an
;; addition.
;;
;; To make this work, instead of tracking the previous $p$ estimate, we track
;; two quantities:
;;
;; - $C_{abc}$ is the delta between $P_{abc}$ and $P_{ab}$, ie, $P_l$.
;; - $D_{abc}$ is the delta between $P_{abc}$ and $P_{bc}$, ie, $P_r$.
;;
;; We can recover the estimates generated by the original Neville's algorithm by
;; summing C values across the first tableau row.
;;
;; Equation 3.1.5 in Numerical recipes gives us the equations we need:
;;
;; $$
;;   C_{abc} = [(x_a - x)(C_{bc} - D_{ab})] / [x_a - x_c] &\
;;           = [(x_l - x)(C_r - D_l)] / [x_l - x_r]
;; $$
;;
;; $$
;;   D_{abc} = [(x_c - x)(C_{bc} - D_{ab})] / [x_a - x_c] &\
;;           = [(x_r - x)(C_r - D_l)] / [x_l - x_r]
;; $$
;;
;; These equations describe a `merge` function for a tableau processing scheme,
;; with state == `[x_l, x_r, C, D]`.
;;
;; Let's implement each method, and then combine them into final form. The
;; following methods use the prefix `mn` for "Modified Neville".

(defn- mn-prepare
  "Processes an initial point [x (f x)] into the required state:

  [x_l, x_r, C, D]

  The recursion starts with $C = D = f(x)$."
  [[x fx]]
  [x x fx fx])

  "Implements the recursion rules described above to generate x_l, x_r, C and D
  for a tableau node, given the usual left and left-up tableau entries."
  [x]
  (fn [[xl _ _ dl] [_ xr cr _]]
    (let [diff   (- cr dl)
          den    (- xl xr)
          factor (/ diff den)
          c      (* factor (- xl x))
          d      (* factor (- xr x))]
      [xl xr c d])))

(defn ^:no-doc mn-present
  "Returns a (lazy) sequence of estimates by successively adding C values from the
  first entry of each tableau column. Each C value is the delta from the
  previous estimate."
  [row]
  (ua/scan
   (map (fn [[_ _ c _]] c) row)))

;; `tableau-fn` allows us to assemble these pieces into a final function that
;; has an interface identical to `neville` above. The implementation is more
;; obfuscated but slightly more efficient.

(defn modified-neville
  "Similar to [[neville]] (the interface is identical) but slightly more efficient.
  Internally this builds up its estimates by tracking the delta from the
  previous estimate.

  This non-obvious change lets us swap an addition in for a multiplication,
  making the algorithm slightly more efficient.

  See [[neville]] for usage information, and info about the required structure
  of the arguments.

  The structure of the [[modified-neville]] algorithm makes it difficult to
  select a particular column. See [[neville]] if you'd like to generate
  polynomial approximations between successive sequences of points.

;; ## Folds and Tableaus by Row
;;
;; NOTE: These folds and scans seem to be higher performance than the functions
;; above. Prefer `*-sum` functions when you want to consume a full sequence of
;; points and get the full input, and `*-scan` functions when you want to
;; observe all intermediate estimates. If you want a /column/ of the tableau,
;; stick with the versions above.
;;
;; The advantage of the method described above, where we generate an entire
;; tableau and lazily pull the first entry off of each column, is that we can
;; pass a lazy sequence in as `points` and get a lazy sequence of successive
;; estimates back. If we don't pull from the result sequence, no computation
;; will occur.
;;
;; One problem with that structure is that we have to have our full sequence of
;; points available when we call a function like `neville`. As you pull an
;; element off of the returned sequence, it just-in-time generates a new
;; diagonal of the tableau required to realize that number.
;;
;; Even if the sequence is lazy, this is limiting. What if we want to pause,
;; save the current estimate and pick up later where we left off?
;;
;; Look at the tableau again:
;;
;; p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234
;; p1 p12 p123 p1234 .
;; p2 p23 p234 .     .
;; p3 p34 .    .     .
;; p4 .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;; .  .   .    .     .
;;
;; If you stare at this for a while, you might notice that it should be possible
;; to use the `merge` and `present` functions we already have to build the
;; tableau one /row/ at a time, given ONLY the previous row:
;;
;; (f [p1 p12 p123 p1234] [x0 fx0]) => [p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234]
;;
;; This method reverses the order of the points, since rows are built from the
;; bottom up:
;;
;; p4 p43 p432 p4321 p43210
;; p3 p32 p321 p3210 .
;; p2 p21 p210 .     .
;; p1 p10 .    .     .
;; p0 .   .    .     .
;;
;; The order of the points is reversed, but this is fine; polynomial
;; interpolation doesn't care about the order of points. (NOTE that this WILL be
;; something we have to consider in the fold version of Richardson
;; extrapolation, in `emmy.polynomial.richardson`!)
;;
;; Notice that the /diagonal/ of this tableau is identical to the top row of the
;; tableau before the points were reversed.
;;
;; Here's something close, using our previous `merge` and `prepare` definitions:

(comment
  (defn generate-new-row* [prepare merge]
    (fn [prev-row point]
      ;; the new point, once it's prepared, is the first entry in the new row.
      ;; From there, we can treat the previous row as a sequence of "r" values.
      (reduce merge (prepare point) prev-row))))

;; There's a problem here. `reduce` only returns the FINAL value of the
;; aggregation:
;;
;;   (let [f (generate-new-row* prepare present)]
;;     (f [p1 p12 p123 p1234] [x0 fx0]))
;;   ;; => p01234
;;
;; If we want to continue building rows, we need the entire new row! Lucky for
;; us, Clojure has a version of `reduce`, called `reductions`, that returns each
;; intermediate aggregation result:

(comment
  (defn generate-new-row [prepare merge]
    (fn [prev-row point]
      (reductions merge (prepare point) prev-row))))

;;   (let [f (generate-new-row prepare present)]
;;     (f [p1 p12 p123 p1234] [x0 fx0]))
;;   ;; => [p0 p01 p012 p0123 p01234]
;;
;; Quick aside here, as we've stumbled across a familiar pattern. The discussion
;; above suggests the idea of a "fold" from functional programming:
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)
;;
;; Folds are explored (and implemented!) in detail in
;; the [[emmy.algebra.fold]] namespace. See that namespace for an
;; introduction, but I'll add a reminder here.
;;
;; A fold consists of:
;;
;; - `init`, an function that returns an initial piece of state called
;;   an "accumulator"
;;
;; - a binary `merge` function that combines ("folds") a new element `x` into
;;   the accumulator, and returns a value of the same shape / type as the
;;   accumulator returned by `init`.
;;
;; - a `present` function that transforms the accumulator into a final value.
;;
;; In Clojure, you perform a fold on a sequence with the `reduce` function:
;;
;;     (reduce merge (init) xs)
;;
;; For example:
;;
;;     (reduce + 0.0 (range 10))

;; Our `generate-new-row` function from above is exactly the `merge` function of
;; a fold. The accumulator is the latest tableau row:

;; `init`    == a function that returns [], the initial empty row.
;;
;; `present` == a function similar to `neville-present` or `mn-present` that
;;              simply sums up the estimate deltas for the entire row, instead
;;              of returning the running tally.
;;
;; `present` only needs to return the final value in each row because that is
;; the best current estimate given all points supplied so far.
;;
;; If you want to recover the previous behavior of a lazy sequence of all
;; estimates, the lazy "scan" pattern of `emmy.util.aggregate/scan` allows
;; you to observe each element of the diagonal of the tableau as it's generated.
;; This is identical to the "first row" of the non-fold tableau.
;;
;; Now that we've identified this new pattern, we can rewrite `generate-new-row`
;; to return a new function matching the fold interface described
;; in [[emmy.algebra.fold]]. The new function is
;; called [[tableau-fold-fn]]:

(defn tableau-fold-fn
  "Given `prepare` and `merge` and `present` functions, returns a fold capable of
  aggregating a point of the form [x, f(x)] into an accumulating tableau
  row (generating the next tableau row).

  The 0-arity of the returned function returns an empty row, `[]`.

  The 1-arity calls the supplied `present` on the accumulated tableau row.

  The 2-arity scans the supplied `merge` across all entries in the accumulating
  row, producing a new row.

  ### More detail on the arguments:

  - `prepare`: a fn that processes each element of the supplied `points` into
  the state necessary to calculate future tableau entries.

  - `merge`: a fn of `l`and `r` the tableau entries:

  l -- return
     /
    /
   /
  r

  the inputs are of the same form returned by `prepare`. `merge` should return a
  new structure of the same form.

  - `present`: Transforms a `tableau` row into an estimate at some value `x` of
  the polynomial interpolated to hit all supplied points."

;; Next, we can use this to generate specialized fold functions for our two
;; incremental algorithms above - `neville` and `modified-neville`.
;;
;; Instead of using `neville-present` as above, `neville-fold` returns only the
;; final estimate. This is because folds are meant to consume their entire input
;; sequence. If you want to observe intermediate values as they're generated,
;; you can use the "scan" pattern, implemented in `neville-scan`.
