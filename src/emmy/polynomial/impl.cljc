;; ## Flat Polynomial Form
;;
;; This namespace uses the sparse exponent representation introduced in
;; `emmy.polynomial.exponent` to build up a polynomial arithmetic package
;; using Clojure vectors. `emmy.polynomial` uses this representation to
;; represent polynomial terms in the [[Polynomial]] data structure.
;;
;; Polynomials are sums of monomial terms; a monomial is a pair of some non-zero
;; coefficient and a product of some number of variables, each raised to some
;; power. The latter are represented by the "exponents" data structure defined
;; in `emmy.polynomial.exponent`.
;;
;; More concisely, polynomials are linear combinations of the exponents.
;;
;;
;; ## Polynomial Terms
;;
;; Terms are represented as pairs of [<exponents>, <coef>].

;; Polynomial Terms
;;
;; Polynomials are represented as ordered vectors of terms. the empty vector
;; needs no ordering:

(def ^:no-doc empty-terms [])

;; For multiple terms, terms are ordered with a [monomial
;; order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order).
;; `emmy.polynomial.exponent` supplies a few of these that you can choose.
;; Set the ordering via the [[*monomial-order*]] dynamic variable.

(def ^:dynamic *monomial-order*
  "This variable defines monomial order used in the construction and arithmetic of
  polynomials. Bind this variable to a comparator on the exponents of each
  monomial term.

  Defaults to [[exponent/graded-lex-order]]."

;; The next-simplest polynomial is a constant polynomial:

(defn constant->terms
  "Given some constant coefficient `coef`, returns a constant polynomial."
  [coef]
  (if (v/zero? coef)
    empty-terms
    [(make-term xpt/empty coef)]))

;; Univariate polynomials can be specified by a sequence of their coefficients:

(defn dense->terms
  "Accepts a sequence of dense coefficients of a univariate polynomial (in
  ascending order), and returns a polynomial in flat polynomial form that
  matches the supplied coefficient sequence.

  For example:

;; When multivariate polynomials have high arity, it can be quite a task to
;; supply every possible term. [[sparse->terms]] allows you to specify a mapping
;; of exponents => coefficient, where "exponents" can be:
;;
;; - a proper exponent entry created by `emmy.polynomial.exponent`
;; - a map of the form `{variable-index, power}`
;; - a dense vector of variable powers, like `[3 0 1]` for $x^3z$.

  "Accepts a sparse mapping (or sequence of pairs) of exponent => coefficient, and
