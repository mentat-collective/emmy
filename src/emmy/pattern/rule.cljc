;; ## Rules
;;
;; A 'rule' is a combination of a possibly-failing matcher (see
;; `emmy.match`), an optional matcher predicate that can introduce NEW
;; bindings, and a consequence function (see `emmy.consequence`)
;;
;; - the matcher (and its predicate) determine whether or not the rule applies
;;   to its data input, and
;; - The consequence can either fail, or successfully return some arbitrary
;;   value or transformation of the bindings from the successful match
;;
;; The final rule is a function from a data input to either failure or a
;; successful transformation.
;;
;; This namespace defines:
;;
;; - the machinery required to create rules, in both function and macro form
;; - some basic rules
;; - combinators to build more advanced rules and term rewriting systems out of
;;   basic rules. These are called "rule combinators".
;;
;; ### Defining Rules
;;
;; Rules are composed from matchers and consequences; these functions are
;; politely aliased into this namespace to make it more self contained.

(defn pattern*

  - any `unquote` or `unquote-splicing` forms respected.

  - A special `failure` singleton (test for this with [[failed?]]), or
  - A successful transformation provided by a consequence function.

  map. A return of `failure`, `nil` or `false` will cause the whole rule to
  fail. To successfully return `nil` or `false`, wrap the result in [[succeed]].

  Notes for the 3-argument case:

  - If the predicate returns `nil`, `false` or `failure`, the rule fails.

  - The predicate can succeed by returning anything else. If the return value is
    a map, the rule will call the consequence function with this map merged in to
    the bindings.
