(ns emmy.pattern.syntax
  "The syntax namespace defines the default syntax for patterns corresponding to
  the matcher combinators defined in [[emmy.pattern.match]]."
  (:require [emmy.util :as u]))

;; ### Notes
;;
;; The current version of the library declares the following syntax rules:
;;
;; - `_` is a wildcard matcher that succeeds with anything and introduces no new
;;   bindings.
;;
;; - `?x` triggers an unrestricted binding match. It will match anything and
;;   introduce a new binding from that symbol to the matched value.
;;
;; - `(? <binding> <predicates...>)` triggers a binding iff all of the predicate
;;   functions appearing after the binding pass for the candidate.
;;
;; - `(?? <binding>)` or `??x` inside of a sequence matches a _segment_ of the
;;   list whose length isn't fixed. Segments will attempt to succed with
;;   successively longer prefixes of the remaining items in the list.
;;
;; - `($$ <binding>)` or `$$x` will only match _after_ the same binding has
;;   already succeeded with a segment. If it has, - this will match a segment
;;   equal to the _reverse_ of the already-bound segment.
;;
;; - `(?? <binding> <predicates...>)` and `($$ <binding> <predicates...>)` are
;;   similar, but only pass iff all of the predicate functions appearing after
;;   the binding pass for the candidate sequence.
;;
;; - Any sequential entry, like a list or a vector, triggers a `sequence` match.
;;   This will attempt to match a sequence, and only pass if its matcher
;;   arguments are able to match all entries in the sequence.

;; ## Pattern Compilation
;;
;; [[compile-pattern]] below allows a macro to take a pattern form with binding

;; things like splice in bindings that are in the current scope.
;;
;; To fix this, we handle `unquote` and `unquote-splicing` directly.

(defn splice-reduce
  "Helper function for reducing over a sequence that might contain forms that need
  to be spliced into the resulting sequence. This is a sort of helper for a
  guarded `mapcat`.

  Takes a sequence `xs` and mapping function `f` and returns a sequence of
  sequences that, if concatenated together, would be identical to

  ```clojure
  (map f xs)
  ```

  Where any `x` such that `(splice? x)` returns true would have its sequential
  value `(f x)` spliced into the result.

  For example:

  ```clojure
  (let [f (fn [x] (if (odd? x)  [x x x] x))]
    (splice-reduce odd? f (range 5)))

  ;;=> [[0] [1 1 1] [2] [3 3 3] [4]]

                             [(conj acc pending (f x)) []])

      (conj acc pending))))

(defn compile-pattern
  "Given a pattern with unquoted binding forms and, potentially, `~` and `~@`
  entries, returns a pattern appropriately quoted such that it can be evaluated
  by the Clojure reader.

  Changes:

  - `(? x) => (list '? 'x)`
  - any bare symbol is quoted
  - Any form unquoted like `~x` is left UNquoted, even in the symbol spot of `(?
    ~sym ...)`
  - Any form marked `~@[1 2 3]` is spliced in directly, EVEN in the symbol spot
    of `(? ~@sym ...)`

  These rules proceed recursively down into map, vector and sequential data
