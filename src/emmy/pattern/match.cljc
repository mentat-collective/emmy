;; # Emmy.Pattern.Matching
;;
;; The library is built out of a few stacked ideas: matcher combinators,
;; matchers, consequences and rules.
;;
;; ### Matcher Combinators
;;
;; - A "matcher combinator" is a function that takes three arguments:
;;
;; `[binding-frame data success-continuation]`
;;
;;  and either returns `nil` or `false`, or calls its `success-continuation`
;;  with a potentially-updated binding map.
;;
;;
;; ### Matcher
;;
;; A `matcher` is a function of a `data` input that can succeed or fail. If it
;; succeeds, it will return the binding map generated by the matching process.
;;
;; On failure, a matcher returns a special `failure` singleton object. You can
;; check for this object using [[fail?]].
;;
;; ### Consequence Functions
;;
;; A consequence is a function from the binding map returned by a matcher to a
;; final form. A consequence can fail by returning `false`, `nil` or the special
;; `failure` singleton.
;;
;; ### Rule
;;
;; A rule is a function of `data` built from a pair of:
;;
;; - a matcher
;; - a consequence function.
;;
;; If the matcher fails on the rule's input, the whole rule returns `failure`.
;; If the match succeeds, the rule calls the consequence function with the
;; matcher's binding map. If THIS function succeeds, the rule returns that
;; value.
;;
;; If the consequence function returns `nil` or `false` (or `failure`), the
;; whole `rule` fails with `failure`.
;;
;; ## Combinators

;; `emmy.pattern.match` contains many matcher combinators. These are either functions
;; with the contract described above, or functions that take one or more
;; combinators and return a new combinator with the same contract. Examples
;; are [[or]], [[not]], [[and]], [[match-when]] and more below.
;;
;; `emmy.pattern.rule` contains many rule combinators, which are either primitive
;; rules or functions from zero or more rules to a new rule.
;;
;; Finally, `emmy.pattern.syntax` defines a small pattern language. Any matcher
;; combinator that take another matcher can take a pattern instead.
;;
;;
;; ### Basic Matcher Combinators

;; ### Matcher Combinators
;;
;; This section introduces functions that are able to build new matcher

;;
;; As an example, you might provide the symbol `'?x` instead of an
;; explicit `(bind '?x)`:

(comment
  (let [m (match-if odd? '?odd '?even)]
    (= [{'?odd 11} {'?even 12}]
       [(m {} 11 identity)

;; ### Lists and Segments
;;
;; Segment variables introduce some additional trouble. Unlike other matchers, a
;; segment variable is not tested against a fixed input, but against a sequence
;; such that it may match any prefix. This means that in general, segment
;; variables must search, trying one match and possibly backtracking.
;;
;; There are two circumstances when the search can be avoided:
;;
;; - if the variable is already bound, the bound value needs to be checked
;;   against the input data, and will either fail or succeed.
;;
;; - If the segment variable is the last matcher in its enclosing list (which
;;   actually happens quite often!) then the segment matcher can match the
;;   entire remaining segment, no search required.
;;
;; This requires a different interface for the continutation. Segment matchers
;; pass TWO arguments into their success continuation - the binding frame, and
;; the remaining unmatched segment.
;;
;; The following two functions let us mark matcher combinators with this
;; interface using their metadata.

(defn as-segment-matcher
  "Takes a matcher and returns `f` with its metadata modified such
  that [[segment-matcher?]] will return `true` when applied to `f`."

  "Returns true if the supplied matcher `f` is a segment matcher, false
  otherwise."
  [f]
  (::segment? (meta f) false))

(defn segment
  "Takes a binding variable `sym` and returns a matcher that calls its success
  continuation with successively longer prefixes of its (sequential) data input
  bound to `sym` inside the frame.

  If `sym` is already present in the frame, the returned matcher only succeeds
  if the bound value is a prefix of the data argument `xs`.

  If `sym` matches the wildcard symbol `_`, the behavior is the same, but no new
  binding is introduced.

  NOTE: the returned matcher will call its success continuation with TWO
  arguments; the new frame and the remaining elements in `xs`. This is a
  different contract than all other matchers, making `segment` appropriate for
  use inside `sequence`."

;;
;; Once you've built up a combinator out of smaller matcher combinators, you can
;; turn your combinator into a "matcher". This is a function from a data object
;; to either:
;;
;; - the binding map, if successful
;; - if failed, a special `failure` singleton object.
;;
;; This interface will become important in `emmy.rule`, for building up
;; groups of rules that can, say, search for the first successful matcher of
;; many, or accumulate binding maps from matchers run in sequence until one
;; fails.
;;
;; The next few functions define this explicit `failure` singleton.
