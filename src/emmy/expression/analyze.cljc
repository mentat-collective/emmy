(ns emmy.expression.analyze
  "This namespace defines an API for working with 'expression analyzers' and
  the [[ICanonicalize]] protocol.

  Expression analyzers find canonical forms of inputs over limited vocabularies
  of operations. For example, a polynomial analyzer will expose operations like
  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation by positive
  integers (but not division).

  An expression containing only these operations and symbols can then be
  converted to and from a polynomial canonical form, which in this example would
  have the effect of grouping like terms; a rational function backend would
  include the division operation and be capable of cancellation. Canonicalizing
  an expression with respect to an analyzer is therefore effected by a
  round-trip to and from the canonical form."

;; ## General Recursive Simplifier Maker
;;
;; The heading, and the following block of comments, is based on the narrative
;; in `simplify/simplify.scm` of the scmutils repository.
;;
;; Given a set of operations, the protocols and functions in this namespace
;; allow you to define recursive simplifiers that simplify expressions involving
;; these operations, treating other combinations as atomic.
;;
;; To break an expression up into manipulable and nonmanipulable parts with
;; respect to a set of algebraic operators. This is done by the introduction of
;; auxiliary variables.
;;
;; For example, the equation
;;
;;    I = Is (exp((V2 - V3)/Vt) - 1) ;; I, V2, V3
;;
;; can be broken into three equations:
;;
;;    I + Is = Is*X                  ;; I, X
;;    V2/Vt - V3/Vt = Y              ;; V2, V3, Y
;;    X = (exp Y)                    ;; X, Y
;;
;; where X and Y are new variables. The first two parts contain only addition,
;; subtraction, multiplication, and division and the third is not expressible in
;; terms of those operations.
;;

  a [Comparator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html)
  function taking account of the input variable set `var-set` in the following
  way:

  If both inputs to the comparator are in `var-set,` or both are not, then the
  results are as `clojure.core/compare` would return. But if one is in `var-set`
  and the other is not, then the other will always compare greater.

  In this way, expressions produced by the simplifier will have simple variables
  sorted earlier than expressions involving those variables."
