(ns emmy.series
  "This namespace contains an implementation of two data types:

  - [[Series]], which represents a generic infinite series of arbitrary values, and
  - [[PowerSeries]], a series that represents a power series in a single
  variable; in other words, a series where the nth entry is interpreted as
  the coefficient of $x^n$:

  ```
  $$[a b c d ...] == $a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3 + ...$$
  ```

  Many of the functions below draw on the [[emmy.series.impl]] namespace,
  which implements many of these operations on bare Clojure sequences.

  The implementation follows Doug McIlroy's beautiful paper, [\"Power Series,
  Power
  Serious\"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.3156&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

  Doug also has a 10-line version in Haskell on [his
  website](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/powser.html)."

  "Returns a [[PowerSeries]] representing the [Taylor
  series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) expansion of `f` at the
  point specified by `xs`. Multiple arguments are allowed. If no arguments `xs`
  are supplied, the expansion point defaults to 0.

  The expansion at 0 is also called a 'Maclaurin series'.

  NOTE: this function takes derivatives internally, so if you pass a function
  make sure you require [[emmy.calculus.derivative]] to install the
  derivative implementation for functions. If you pass some other callable,
  differentiable function-like thing, like a polynomial, this is not necessary.

  NOTE: The typical definition of a Taylor series of `f` expanded around some
  point `x` is

  $$T(p) = f(x) + \\frac{f'(x)}{1!}(p-x) + \\frac{f''(x)}{2!} (p-x)^2 + \\ldots,$$

  where `p` is the evaluation point. When `(= p x)`, all derivatives of the
  Taylor series expansion of `f` will exactly match the derivatives of `f`
  itself.

  The Taylor series returned here (call it $T'$) is actually a function of `dx`,
  where

  $$T'(dx) = T(x+dx) = f(x) + \\frac{f'(x)}{1!}(dx) + \\frac{f''(x)}{2!} (dx)^2 + \\ldots.$$"

     (->PowerSeries (gen 1 f 1)))))

;; ## Application
;;
;; Given some power series $F$, we can "apply" the series to a value $x$ by
;; multiplying each entry $f_n$ by $x^n$:

(defn- power-series-value
  "Evaluates the power series, and converts it back down to a normal series."
  [f x]
  (let [one    (v/one-like x)
        powers (iterate #(g/* x %) one)]
    (map g/* f powers)))

;; Once a `PowerSeries` has been applied, it becomes a `Series`.
;;
;; What does it mean to apply a `Series`? The concept only makes sense if the
;; series contains "applicables", or objects that can act as functions
;; themselves.
;;
;; If it does, then application of a series to some argument list `xs` means
;; applying each series element to `xs`.
;;
;; One further wrinkle occurs if the applicable in some position returns a
;; series. `value` should combine all of these resulting series, with each
;; series shifted by its initial position in the first series.
;; Concretely, suppose that $F$ has the form:
;;
;; $$(x => (A1, A2, A3, ...), x => (B1, B2, B3, ...) x => (C1, C2, C3, ...), ...)$$

;; Then, this series applied to x should yield the series of values
;; (A1, (+ A2 B1), (+ A3 B2 C1), ...)
;;
;; Here's the implementation:

(defn- series-value [f xs]
  (letfn [(collect [f]
            (let [result (apply (first f) xs)]
              (if (series? result)

                ;; note that we have already realized first-result,
                ;; so it does not need to be behind lazy-seq.

(defn value
  "Returns the value of the supplied [[Series]] or [[PowerSeries]] applied to `xs`.

  If a [[PowerSeries]] is supplied, `xs` (despite its name) must be a single
  value. Returns a [[Series]] generated by multiplying each `i`th term in `s` by
  $x^i$, where $x$ is the `xs` argument.

  If a [[Series]] `s` is supplied:

  Assumes that `s` is a series of applicables of arity equal to the count of
  `xs`. If, in fact, `s` is a series of series-valued applicables, then the
  result will be a sort of layered sum of the values.

  Concretely, suppose that `s` has the form:

  ```
  [x => [A1 A2 A3...], x => [B1 B2 B3...], x => [C1 C2 C3...], ...]
  ```

  Then, this series applied to x will yield the new series:

  ```
  [A1 (+ A2 B1) (+ A3 B2 C1) ...]

  as the coefficient of the $x^n$ term, the series must shift by $n$ positions

;;
;; This section installs `Series` and `PowerSeries` into the Emmy generic
;; arithmetic system.
;;
;; A key idea here is that all "coefficients" of a series must be some kind
;; derived from `::coseries`. This is _not_ true in the Scheme scmutils library;
;; in that library, anything that responds false to `series?` is game for
;; interaction with series objects.
;;
;; NOTE This might be the right way to go. Feel free to experiment.

(derive ::v/function ::coseries)

;; All generic methods:
;;
;; - unwrap the supplied series instances,
;; - operate directly on their backing sequences
;; - repackage the result using the appropriate constructor
;;
;; This section does _not_ define methods that coerce `Series` => `PowerSeries`
;; or vice versa. Users should do this explicitly.
