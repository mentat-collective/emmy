;; # Flat Polynomial Form, for Commutative Rings
;;
;; This namespace builds up an implementation of a
;; multivariate [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) data
;; structure and installs it into the tower of generic operations.
;;
;; Summarizing the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial),
;; a polynomial is an expression of any number of 'variables', or
;; 'indeterminates' and concrete 'coefficients', combined using only the
;; operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication of coefficients and
;; variables.
;;
;; Here's an example of a polynomial of arity 2, i.e., a polynomial in two
;; variables:
;;
;; $$4 + 3x^2y + 5y^3 + 6x^4$$
;;
;; ## Terminology
;;
;; In the above example:
;;
;; - The full expression is called a 'polynomial'.
;;
;; - A polynomial is a sum of
;;   many ['monomial'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial) terms; these are
;;   $4$, $3x^2y$, $5y^3$ and $6x^4$ in the example above.
;;
;; - Each monomial term is a product of a coefficient and a sequence of
;;   'exponents', some product of the term's variables. The monomial $3x^2y$ has
;;   coefficient $3$ and exponents $x^2y$.
;;
;; NOTE that sometimes the exponents here are called "monomials", without the
;; coefficient. If you find that usage, the full 'coefficient * exponents' is
;; usually called a 'polynomial term'.
;;
;; - The number of variables present in a polynomial is called the 'arity' of
;;   the polynomial. (The arity of our example is 2.)
;;
;; - A polynomial with a single variable is called a 'univariate' polynomial; a
;;   multivariable polynomial is called a 'multivariate' polynomial.
;;
;; - The [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#Multiplication)
;;   of a monomial term is the sum of the exponents of each variable in the
;;   term, with the special case that the [degree of a 0
;;   term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial#Degree_of_the_zero_polynomial)
;;   is defined as -1. The degrees of each term in our example are 0, 3, 3 and
;;   4, respectively.
;;
;; - The degree of a polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of the
;;   polynomial's terms.
;;
;; There are, of course, more definitions! Whenever these come up in the
;; implementation below, see the documentation for explanation.
;;
;; ## Implementation
;;
;; Emmy makes the following implementation choices:
;;
;; - The exponents of a monomial are represented by an ordered mapping of
;;   variable index => the exponent of that variable. $x^2z^3$ is represented as
;;   `{0 2, 2 3}`, for example. See `emmy.polynomial.exponent` for the full
;;   set of operations you can perform on a term's exponents.
;;
;;  This representation is called `sparse` because variables with a 0 exponent
;;  aren't included.
;;
;; - A monomial term is a vector of the form `[<exponents>, <coefficient>]`. The
;;   coefficient can be any type! It's up to the user to supply coefficients
;;   drawn from a commutative ring. See [[emmy.laws/ring]] for a
;;   description of the properties coefficients should satisfy.
;;
;; - A polynomial is a sorted vector of monomials, sorted in some
;;   consistent [Monomial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial_order).
;;   See [[emmy.polynomial.impl/*monomial-order*]] for the current default.
;;
;; `emmy.polynomial.impl` builds up polynomial arithmetic on bare vectors
;; of monomials, for efficiency's sake. This namespace builds this base out into
;; a full [[Polynomial]] data structure with a fleshed-out API.
;;
;; To follow along in full, first read `emmy.polynomial.exponent`, then
;; `emmy.polynomial.impl`... then come back and continue from here.
;;
;; ## Polynomial Type Definition
;;
;; As noted above, a polynomial is defined by a sorted vector of terms.
;; The [[Polynomial]] type wraps up these `terms`, the `arity` of the polynomial
;; and optional metadata `m`.

  - a sequence of dense coefficients of a univariate polynomial (in ascending

  - an explicit `arity`, and a sparse mapping (or sequence of pairs) of exponent
  => coefficient

  In the first case, the sequence is interpreted as a dense sequence of
  coefficients of an arity-1 (univariate) polynomial. The coefficients begin
  with the constant term and proceed to each higher power of the indeterminate.
  For example, x^2 - 1 can be constructed by (make [-1 0 1]).

  In the 2-arity case,

  - `arity` is the number of indeterminates
  - `expts->coef` is a map of an exponent representation to a coefficient.

  The `exponent` portion of the mapping can be any of:

  - a proper exponent entry created by `emmy.polynomial.exponent`
  - a map of the form `{variable-index, power}`
  - a dense vector of variable powers, like `[3 0 1]` for $x^3z$. The length of
    each vector should be equal to `arity`, in this case.

  For example, any of the following would generate $4x^2y + 5xy^2$:

  ```clojure
  (make 2 [[[2 1] 4] [[1 2] 5]])
  (make 2 {[2 1] 4, [1 2] 5})
  (make 2 {{0 2, 1 1} 4, {0 1, 1 2} 5})
  ```

  NOTE: [[make]] will try and return a bare coefficient if possible. For
  example, the following form will return a constant, since there are no
  explicit indeterminates with powers > 0:

  ```clojure
  (make 10 {{} 1 {} 2})

;; ## Generic Implementations
;;
;; The functions above were written to handle any non-[[Polynomial]]
;; coefficient; it's up to the user to provide only commutative rings.
;;
;; The `::coeff` keyword allows the Emmy generic dispatch system to act as
;; a guard here. By default, modular integers and anything deriving from
;; `::v/scalar` will interact with [[Polynomial]] instances when they meet via
;; generic `+`, `-`, `*` and a few other functions defined below. To install
;; another type, simply use a `derive` form like those below.
