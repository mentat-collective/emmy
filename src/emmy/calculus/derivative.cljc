;; ## IPerturbed Implementation for Functions
;;
;; The following section, along with [[emmy.collection]]
;; and [[emmy.differential]], rounds out the implementations
;; of [[d/IPerturbed]] for native Clojure(script) data types. The function
;; implementation is subtle, as described by [Manzyuk et al.
;; 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4892.pdf).
;; ([[emmy.derivative.calculus-test]], in the "Amazing Bug" sections,
;; describes the pitfalls at length.)
;;
;; [[emmy.differential]] describes how each in-progress perturbed variable
;; in a derivative is assigned a "tag" that accumulates the variable's partial
;; derivative.
;;
;; How do we interpret the case where `((D f) x)` produces a _function_?
;;
;; [Manzyuk et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.4892.pdf) extends `D` to
;; functions `f` of type $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \alpha$, where
;;
;; $$\alpha::=\mathbb{R}^m \mid \alpha_{1} \rightarrow \alpha_{2}$$
;;
;; By viewing
;;
;; - `f` as a (maybe curried) multivariable function that _eventually_ must
;;   produce an $\mathbb{R}^m$
;; - The derivative `(D f)` as the partial derivative with respect to the first
;;   argument of `f`
;;
;; A 3-level nest of functions will respond to `D` just like the flattened,
;; non-higher-order version would respond to `(partial 0)`. In other words,
;; these two forms should evaluate to equivalent results:

(comment
  (let [f (fn [x]
            (fn [y]
              (fn [z]
                (g/* x y z))))]
    ((((D f) 'x) 'y) 'z))
  ;;=> (* y z)

  (((partial 0) g/*) 'x 'y 'z))
  ;;=> (* y z)


;; To `extract-tangent` from a function, we need to compose the
;; `extract-tangent` operation with the returned function.
;;
;; The returned function needs to capture an internal reference to the
;; original [[d/Differential]] input. This is true for any Functor-shaped return
;; value, like a structure or Map. However! There is a subtlety present with
;; functions that's not present with vectors or other containers.
;;
;; The difference with functions is that they take _inputs_. If you contrive a
;; situation where you can feed the original captured [[d/Differential]] into
;; the returned function, this can trigger "perturbation confusion", where two
;; different layers try to extract the tangent corresponding to the SAME tag,
;; and one is left with nothing.
;;
;; If you engineer an
;; example (see [[emmy.calculus.derivative-test/amazing-bug]]) where:
;;
;; - this function takes another function, which then receives the closed-over
;;   `x` as an argument
;; - you pass this function to itself, so the closed-over `x` instances can both
;;   be multiplied
;;
;; Then your program isn't going to make any distinction between the instances
;; of `x`. They're both references to the same value.
;;
;; HOWEVER! `((D f) x)` returns a function which, when you eventually provide
;; all arguments, will return the sensitivity of `f` to the first argument `x`.
;;
;; If you perform the trick above, pass `((D f) x)` into itself, and the `x`
;; instances meet (multiply, say) - should final return value treat them as the
;; /same/ instance?
;;
;; Manzyuk et al. says _NO!_. If `((D f) x)` returns a function, that function
;; closes over:
;;
;; - the value of `x`
;; - an _intention_ to start the derivative-taking process on that isolated copy
;;   of `x` once the final argument is supplied.
;;
;; How does the implementation keep the values separate?
;;
;; ### Tag Replacement
;;
;; The key to the solution lives in [[extract-tangent-fn]], called on the result
;; of `((D f) x)` when `((D f) x)` produces a function. We have to armor the
;; returned function so that:
;;
;; - it extracts the originally-injected tag when someone eventually calls the
;;   function
;; - if some caller passes a new [[d/Differential]] instance into the function,
;;   any tags in that [[d/Differential]] will survive on their way back out...
;;   even if they happen to contain the originally-injected tag.
;;
;; We do this by:
;;
;; - replacing any instance of the original `tag` in the returned function's
;;   arguments with a temporary tag (let's call it `fresh`)
;; - calling the function and extracting the tangent component associated with
;;   `tag`, as requested (note now that the only instances of `tag` that can
;;   appear in the result come from variables captured in the function's
;;   closure)
;; - remapping `fresh` back to `tag` inside the remaining [[d/Differential]]
;;   instance.
;;
;; This last step ensures that any tangent tagged with `tag` in the input can
;; make it back out without tangling with closure-captured `tag` instances that
;; some higher level might want.

(defn- extract-tangent-fn
  "Returns a new function that composes a 'tag extraction' step with `f`. The
  returned fn will

  - call the underlying `f`, producing `result`
  - return `(extract-tangent result tag)`

  If called within the scope of a function waiting for the same `tag`, the
  returned function will remap any instance of `tag` that appears in any
  differential argument passed to it to a private `fresh` tag, to prevent
  internal perturbation confusion. Any tangent components in the final result
  tagged with `fresh` will be remapped in the final result back to `tag`.

  If called _outside_ of a function waiting for `tag` no tag remapping will

  "Given a differentiable function `f` and any number of arguments `xs`, returns
  a [[emmy.series/PowerSeries]] representing the [Taylor
  series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) of the function `f`
  expanded at `xs`.

  Calling [[taylor-series]] with no arguments will return the [Maclaurin
  series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series#List_of_Maclaurin_series_of_some_common_functions)
  of `f`, i.e., the Taylor series expansion at `(= x 0)`.

  Calling the returned power series with incremental argument `dx` will produce
  a [[emmy.series/Series]] representing the terms of the Taylor series of
  `f` expanded at `x` and evaluated at `x+dx`.

  NOTE: Just like the [[D]] operator, functions `f` of multiple-arguments are
  treated as a function of a single structural argument. If you pass multiple
  arguments `xs`, you'll have to manually wrap your multiple-argument `dx` in
  a [[emmy.structure/up]] or a vector before passing it to the returned
  power series.

  NOTE: The typical definition of a Taylor series of `f` expanded around some
  point `x` is

  $$T(p) = f(x) + \\frac{f'(x)}{1!}(p-x) + \\frac{f''(x)}{2!} (p-x)^2 + \\ldots,$$

  where `p` is the evaluation point. When `(= p x)`, all derivatives of the
  Taylor series expansion of `f` will exactly match the derivatives of `f`
  itself.

  The Taylor series returned here (call it $T'$) is actually a function of `dx`,
