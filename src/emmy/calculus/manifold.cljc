;; # Disclaimer (from @sritchie)
;;
;; I'm convinced that the scmutils code used to implement the ideas
;; in "Functional Differential Geometry" doesn't have the final say on the best
;; API for differential geometry. I'm going to leave notes throughout the
;; namespace suggesting ways that we might make it better; please take these as
;; challenges and erase the notes as you make improvements!
;;
;; Big TODO items:
;;
;; - `manifold` and `patch` should be protocols, so that manifolds, patches and
;;   coordinate systems can report their manifold, and patches and coordinate
;;   systems can report their patch. `point` can report its manifold too. Once
;;   this change is made, `transfer-point` should use the `manifold` protocol to
;;   simplify its implementation. (NOTE that `manifold` now works on coordsys
;;   and manifolds, but not yet on patches.)
;;
;; - `patch`, `manifold` and `point` should be defrecords, so that they can
;;   implement the protocols above in different ways. We can also implement
;;   `dimension` correctly.
;;
;; - `make-patch` should return a patch template; only when you specialize the
;;   manifold, or retrieve the patch FROM the specialized manifold with
;;   `get-patch` should you actually build the defrecord.
;;
;; - the original codebase assigns a UUID to each manifold specialized off a
;;   family. Is this a good idea?
;;
;; - coordinate systems now use a UUID in the protocol; this feels like a code
;;   smell. This exists so that coordinate prototypes can live in metadata, and
;;   can be changed without affecting equality of coordinate systems. BUT
;;   reconsider this design!
;;
;; - coordinate systems have many more functions like `access-chains`,
;;  `dual-chains`, `coordinate-basis` and friends. These are missing, and SHOULD
;;  go into `coordinate.cljc.` Basically caching functions that can do these
;;  transformations for a coordinate system should live in one spot.
;;
;; - it feels like `ICoordinateSystem` WANTS to live in `coordinate.cljc`... but
;;   maybe not. I have a sense that we're a bit tangled.
;;
;; - keeping caches inside the points feels wrong. Can we just cache the
;;   function itself?
;;
;; - There is a huge amount of repetition between the different coordinate
;;   system definitions! There is clearly a smaller protocol that would work,
;;   like `point->coords` and `coords->point`, plus maybe the validator.
;;   `my-manifold-point?` does all the work for point checking, and we can
;;   compose with a coordinate system defrecord to return `manifold`, `patch`
;;   and `prototype.`
;;
;;  If we do this it'll make it easier to memoize just these smaller functions,
;;  and keep an outer `point->coords` that can memoize the internal thing.
;;
;; - TODO: document all of the coordinate systems at the bottom of the page!
;;
;; - TODO: more tests of all of the new accessor functions. See Codecov for what
;; - to do here.
;;
;; Okay, on to the business.
;;
;;
;; ## Manifold Families
;;
;; Manifolds like R1, R2, S1, S2 etc are specialized versions of "manifold
;; templates" like Rn and Sn. We call these "manifold families", while scmutils
;; calls these "manifold types".
;;
;; NOTE: rather than taking a `name-format` string, `make-manifold-family`
;; should take a function of the single dimension argument.
;;
;; NOTE: the original scmutils codebase keeps a `:distinguished-points` list
;; inside the manifold family. This isn't used anywhere in the book or codebase.
;; Keep an eye out and either implement or delete this note.

   We map the nothern hemisphere to the plane by firing a ray from the origin.
   The coordinates are given by the intersection with the z = 1 plane.
   x(t) = t*m
   x_n(t) = t*m_n, 1 = x_n(1/m_n)

  `orientation-function` should should return an n+1-by-n+1 orthogonal matrix.
  It can be interpreted as moving the plane of projection, and point mapped to
  the origin, as well as possibly reflecting.

   Given the coordinates x we have

   <x,x> = (1-m_n^2)/m_n^2
   1 + <x,x> = (m_n^2 + 1 - m_n^2)/m_n^2
   m_n = sqrt(1/(1+<x,x>))

   where positive square root is sufficient for the northern hemisphere."
