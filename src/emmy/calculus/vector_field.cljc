;; ## Vector Fields
;;
;; A vector field is an operator that takes a smooth real-valued function of a
;; manifold and produces a new function on the manifold which computes the
;; directional derivative of the given function at each point of the manifold.
;;
;; As with other differential operators such as D, a vector-field operator
;; multiplies by composition. Like D it takes the given function to another
;; function of a point.
