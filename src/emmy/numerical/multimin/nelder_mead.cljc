  evaluation.

  `:info?` if true, wraps the result with evaluation information.

  `:adaptive?` if true, the Nelder-Mead parameters for contraction, expansion,
  reflection and shrinking will be set adaptively, as functions of the number of
  dimensions. If false they stay constant.

  `:alpha` sets the reflection coefficient used for each step of Nelder-Mead.

  `:beta` sets the expansion coefficient used for each step of Nelder-Mead.

  `:gamma` sets the contraction coefficient used for each step of Nelder-Mead.

  `:sigma` sets the shrink coefficient used for each step of Nelder-Mead.

  `:maxiter` Maximum number of iterations allowed for the minimizer. Defaults to

  `:maxfun` Maximum number of times the function can be evaluated before exiting.
  Defaults to 200*dimension.

  `:simplex-tolerance` When the absolute value of the max difference between the
  best point and any point in the simplex falls below this tolerance, the
  minimizer stops. Defaults to 1e-4.

  `:fn-tolerance` When the absolute value of the max difference between the best
  point's function value and the fn value of any point in the simplex falls
  below this tolerance, the minimizer stops. Defaults to 1e-4.

  `:zero-delta` controls the value to which 0 entries in the initial vector are
  set during initial simplex generation. Defaults to 0.00025.

  `:nonzero-delta` factor by which entries in the initial vector are perturbed to
  generate the initial simplex. Defaults to 0.05.
