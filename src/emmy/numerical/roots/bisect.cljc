;;

;; root-finding; bisection search, the [Secant
;; method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method) and a mixed method found
;; in scmutils.
;;
;; NOTE: As we bring in methods like `zbrent` it could be that the shell below
;; should be shared for ALL root finding methods.

(defn bisect
  "Given some function `f` and (inclusive) lower and upper bounds `a` and `b` on
  the domain, attempts to find a root of `f` in that range, i.e., a value `x` for
  which `(f x)` is equal to 0.

  Supports the following optional keyword arguments:

  `:method`: can be `:bisection`, `:secant` or `:mixed`. See the Methods section
  below for a description of each. Defaults to `:mixed`

  `:eps`: defaults to [[emmy.value/machine-epsilon]].

  `:callback`: if supplied, the supplied `f` will be invoked at each
  intermediate point with the iteration count and the values of x and f(x) at
  each search step.

  `:maxiter`: maximum number of iterations allowed for the minimizer. Defaults to
  1000.

  `:maxfun` maximum number of times the function can be evaluated before
  exiting. Defaults to `(inc maxiter)`.

  `:n-break` defaults to the dynamically bindable `*bisect-break*` (which
  defaults to 60). Bind `*bisect-break*` to modify the behavior of the `:mixed`
  method (see below) when it's used inside a nested routine. Ignored if method
  is not `:mixed`.

  ## Methods

  - `:bisection` causes [[bisect]] to use the [Bisection
    method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method); at each iteration,
    the midpoint between the bounds is chosen as the next point.

  - `:secant` uses the [Secant
    method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method); each candidate point is
    chosen by taking the root of a line drawn between the two endpoints `[a (f
    a)]` and `[b (f b)]`. This method is most useful when the bounds are close to
    the root.

  - `:mixed` uses `:bisection` up until `:n-break` iterations and `:secant`
    beyond. This can be useful for narrowing down a very wide range close to the
    root, and then switching in to a faster search method."
