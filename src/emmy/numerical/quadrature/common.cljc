;; This dynamic variable holds the default "roundoff cutoff" used by all
;; integrators to decide when to return an estimate based on a single slice, vs
;; attempting to converge a sequence of progressively finer estimates. When this

;; |b - a| / |a| + |b| <= `cutoff`
;;
;; An integrator will estimate a single slice directly. Else, it will attempt to
;; converge a sequence.

;; NOTE - we don't have an interface yet to bind this dynamic variable. bind it
;; manually to modify the cutoff for a specific call to some integrator:
;;
;; (binding [*roundoff-cutoff* 1e-6]

;; ## Common Integration Interface
;;
;; The following two functions define a shared interface that integration
;; namespaces can use to create an "integrator" from:
;;
;; - a fn that can estimate the area of a single integration slice, and
;; - a fn that can return a sequence of progressively finer estimates.
;;
;; The first function is called in the case that the integration range $(a,
;; b)$ (open or closed) is too fine for subdivision. The second function takes
;; over in all other (most!) cases.

  - `(area-fn f a b)` estimates the integral of `f` over the interval `(a, b)`
  with no subdivision, nothing clever at all.

  - `(seq-fn f a b opts)` returns a sequence of successively refined estimates
  of the integral of `f` over `(a, b)`. `opts` can contain kv pairs that
  configure the behavior of the sequence function (a sequence of the number of
  integration slices to use, for example.)

  The returned function has the signature:

  `(f a b opts)`

  All `opts` are passed on to `seq-fn`, _and_ to `us/seq-limit` internally,
  where the options configure the checks on sequence convergence."
