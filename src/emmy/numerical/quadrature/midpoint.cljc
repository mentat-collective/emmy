;; ## Midpoint Method
;;
;; This namespace builds on the ideas introduced in `riemann.cljc`.
;;
;; `riemann.cljc` described four different integration schemes ({left, right,
;; upper, lower} Riemann sums) that were each conceptually simple, but aren't
;; often used in practice, even in their "accelerated" forms.
;;
;; One reason for this is that their error terms fall off as $h, h^2, h^3$,
;; where $h$ is the width of an integration slice. Each order of sequence
;; acceleration can cancel out one of these terms at a time; but still, the
;; performance is not great.
;;
;; It turns out that by taking the /midpoint/ if each interval, instead of
;; either side, you can reduce the order of the error series to $O(h^2)$. This
;; is too good to pass up.
;;
;; Additionally, because the error terms fall off as $h^2, h^4, h^6, ...$, each
;; order of acceleration is worth quite a bit more than in the Riemann sum case.
;;
;; This namespace follows the same development as `riemann.cljc`:
;;
;; - implement a simple, easy-to-understand version of the Midpoint method
;; - make the computation more efficient
;; - write an incremental version that can reuse prior results
;; - wrap everything up behind a nice, exposed API
;;
;;
;; ## Simple Midpoint Rule
;;
;; Here's an implementation of a function that can take the midpoint of a single
;; slice:

(defn ^:no-doc single-midpoint [f a b]
  (let [width      (g/- b a)
        half-width (g// width 2)
        midpoint   (g/+ a half-width)]
    (g/* width (f midpoint))))

;; And a full (though inefficient) integrator using `windowed-sum`:

(defn- midpoint-sum* [f a b]
  (let [area-fn (partial single-midpoint f)]
    (qr/windowed-sum area-fn a b)))

;; Let's integrate a triangle!

(comment
  (= (* 0.5 10 10)
     ((midpoint-sum* identity 0.0 10.0) 10)))
;; => true

;; ## Efficient Midpoint Method
;;
;; It turns out that we already had to implement an efficient version of
;; `midpoint-sum` in `riemann.cljc`; the incremental version of left and right
;; Riemann sums added the midpoints of each interval when doubling the number of
;; slices.
;;
;; We can check our implementation against `qr/midpoint-sum`:

(comment
  (= ((midpoint-sum* identity 0.0 100.0) 10)
     ((qr/midpoint-sum identity 0.0 100.0) 10)))

;; We'll use `qr/midpoint-sum` in the upcoming functions.

;; ## Incremental Midpoint Method
;;
;; Unlike the left and right Riemann sums, the Midpoint method can't reuse
;; function evaluations when the number of slices doubles. This is because each
;; evaluation point, on a doubling, becomes the new border between slices:
;;
;; ```
;; n = 1 |-------x-------|
;; n = 2 |---x---|---x---|
;; ```
;;
;; If you /triple/ the number of slices from $n$ to $3n$, you can in fact reuse
;; the previous $n$ evaluations:
;;
;; ```
;; n = 1 |--------x--------|
;; n = 3 |--x--|--x--|--x--|
;; ```
;;
;; By scaling $S_n$ down by a factor of 3, and adding it to a new sum that only
;; includes the new points (using the new slice width).
;;
;; BTW: The only place I found this idea mentioned is in Section 4.4 of
;; Press's ["Numerical
;; Recipes"](http://phys.uri.edu/nigh/NumRec/bookfpdf/f4-4.pdf). I haven't found
;; other references to this trick, or implementations. I'd love to hear about
;; them (via a Github issue) if you find any!
;;
;; We'll follow the interface we used for `qr/Sn->S2n` and write `Sn->S3n`. This
;; function of $f, a, b$ will return a function that performs the incremental
;; update.
;;
;; The returned function generates $S_{3n}$ across $(a, b)$ with $n$ intervals,
;; and picking out two new points at $h \over 6$ and $5h \over 6$ of the way
;; across the old interval. These are the midpoints of the two new slices with
;; width $h \over 3$.
;;
;; Sum them all up and add them to $S_n \over 3$ to generate $S_{3n}$:

(defn- Sn->S3n [f a b]
  (let [width (- b a)]
    (fn [Sn n]
      (let [h        (/ width n)
            delta    (/ h 6)
            l-offset (+ a delta)
            r-offset (+ a (* 5 delta))
            fx (fn [i]
                 (let [ih (* i h)]
                   (+ (f (+ l-offset ih))
                      (f (+ r-offset ih)))))]
        (-> (+ Sn (* h (ua/sum fx 0 n)))
            (/ 3.0))))))

;; Now we can write `midpoint-sequence`, analogous to `qr/left-sequence`. This
;; implementation reuses all the tricks from `qr/incrementalize`; this means it
;; will be smart about using the new incremental logic any time it sees any $n$
;; multiple of 3, just as the docstring describes.

(defn midpoint-sequence
  "Returns a (lazy) sequence of successively refined estimates of the integral of
  `f` over the open interval $(a, b)$ using the Midpoint method.

  ### Optional arguments:

  `:n`: If `:n` is a number, returns estimates with $n, 3n, 9n, ...$ slices,
  geometrically increasing by a factor of 3 with each estimate.

  If `:n` is a sequence, the resulting sequence will hold an estimate for each
  integer number of slices in that sequence.

  `:accelerate?`: if supplied (and `n` is a number), attempts to accelerate
  convergence using Richardson extrapolation. If `n` is a sequence this option
  is ignored."

;; The following example shows that for the sequence $2, 3, 4, 6, ...$ (used in
;; the Bulirsch-Stoer method!), the incrementally-augmented `midpoint-sequence`
;; only performs 253 function evaluations, vs the 315 of the non-incremental
;; `(midpoint-sum f2 0 1)` mapped across the points.

   [@counter1 @counter2]))

;; ## Final Midpoint API
;;
;; The final version is analogous the `qr/left-integral` and friends, including
;; an option to `:accelerate?` the final sequence with Richardson extrapolation.
;;
;; I'm not sure what to call this accelerated method. Accelerating the trapezoid
;; method in this way is called "Romberg integration". Using an $n$ sequence of
;; powers of 2 and accelerating the midpoint method by a single step - taking
;; the second column (index 1) of the Richardson tableau - produces "Milne's
;; method".
;;
;; The ability to combine these methods makes it easy to produce powerful
;; methods without known names. Beware, and enjoy!
;;
;; ### Note on Richardson Extrapolation
;;
;; We noted above that the the terms of the error series for the midpoint method
;; increase as $h^2, h^4, h^6$... Because of this, we pass $p = q = 2$ into
;; `pr/richardson-sequence` below. Additionally, `integral` hardcodes the factor
;; of `3` and doesn't currently allow for a custom sequence of $n$. This
;; requires passing $t = 3$ into `pr/richardson-sequence`.
;;
;; If you want to accelerate some other geometric sequence, call
;; `pr/richardson-sequence` with some other value of `t.`
;;
;; To accelerate an arbitrary sequence of midpoint evaluations, investigate
;; `polynomial.cljc` or `rational.cljc`. The "Bulirsch-Stoer" method uses either
;; of these to extrapolate the midpoint method using a non-geometric sequence.
