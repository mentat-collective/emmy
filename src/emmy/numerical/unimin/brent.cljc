  `max(x - a, b - x) <= 2tol`

  From Numerical Recipes:

  \"A typical ending configuration for Brent's method is that $a$ and $b$
  are `(* 2 midpoint tol)` apart, with $x$ (the best abscissa) at the midpoint
  of $a$ and $b$, and therefore fractionally accurate to +-tol.\" ~Numerical

  - The interval width between the new `a` and `b` after the algorithm completes
    this golden step
  - The delta that needs to be applied to `x` to take it into the larger of the
    two gaps between `a` and `b,` ie, to `new_x`:

  `xa---------new_x<---xx------xb`

  NOTE that in Brent's algorithm, a golden section step wipes out the tracked
  history of `p/q` parabolic steps that the algorithm uses to decide between
  parabolic and golden section steps.

  The goal of the dance is to force a golden section step every $log_2((b - a) /
  tol1)$ steps by allowing a parabolic step as long as it halves the step taken
  two iterations ago. Without this reset the algorithm would attempt fewer
  beneficial parabolic steps."

(defn- parabola-valid?
  "The parabolic step `p/q` is valid if the step:

  - keeps the candidate point `x` inbounds, ie, `a < x + p/q < b`
  - is at least 1/2 of `target`.

  `target` is a slightly tricky quantity, and depends on the type of step taken
  in the previous two iterations:

  -  *, golden: `target` == the full `(a, b)` interval `b - a`
  -  golden, *: `target` == the size of the step taken by the previous golden
  - para, para: `target` == `p/q` from two steps ago

  The idea is to force a golden section step every so often by narrowing the
  allowed jump that a parabolic step is allowed to take, and then widening the
  band to the full range whenever a golden section step occurs.

  Why the step before last? Experimentally (according to Brent) it works better
  than considering only the previous step, and aesthetically it feels right to
  give parabolic interpolation more than one try to do a nice job."

(defn brent-min
  "Find the minimum of the function f: R -> R in the interval [a,b] using Brent's

  Derivatives](https://books.google.com/books?id=AITCAgAAQBAJ&q=Brent%E2%80%99s#v=onepage&q=Parabolic&f=false).

  Brent's method is a combination of a golden section search with a parabolic
  interpolation step. Parabolic interpolation can go wild if the candidate point
  is close to colinear with the search bounds, or of the points are too close
  together.

  Brent's method prevents this by applying an internal test that forces a golden
  section step every so often. (If you want the details, see `parabola-valid?`
  above.)

  Supports the following optional keyword arguments:

  `:callback` if supplied, the supplied fn will be invoked at each intermediate
  point with the iteration count and the values of x and f(x) at each search
  step.

  `:relative-threshold` defaults to around 1.49e8, the sqrt of the machine
  tolerance. You won't gain any benefit attempting to set the value less than
  the default.

  `:absolute-threshold` a smaller absolute threshold that applies when the
  candidate minimum point is close to 0.

  `:maxiter` Maximum number of iterations allowed for the minimizer. Defaults to
  1000.

  `:maxfun` Maximum number of times the function can be evaluated before
  exiting. Defaults to `(inc maxiter)`.
