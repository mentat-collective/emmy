;; # Golden Section Method
;;
;; The golden section method is an algorithm for locating the minimum of a
;; single variable function without access to its derivative.

;; Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search
;;
;; Start with the two endpoints `a` and `b` that you know bound a minimum, and
;; choose two interior points to test. (The goal is to progressively narrow your
;; search window; you need two points to know where to zoom in.)
;;
;; If the left point `l` has a lower function value, zoom in to `(a, r)`. Else,
;; zoom to `(l, b)` for the next round.
;;
;; How do you pick the points? Use the golden ratio. There are two ways to cut
;; an interval using the golden ratio. Each results in a larger and smaller piece.
;;
;; The "golden ratio" is the interval such that the ratio of the LARGER piece to
;; the whole is the same as the ratio of the smaller piece to the larger piece.
;; By choosing your interior points using the golden ratio, you guarantee that
;; whether you zoom in to `(a, r)` or `(l, b)`, both pieces will cover the same
;; ratio of the the total interval, every time. Any ratio other than the golden
;; ratio could degenerate into you selecting the larger of the two pieces every
;; time, slowing your search.

  Supports the following optional keyword arguments:

  `:converged?` is an optional predicate accepting five arguments:

  - `[a fa]`
  - `[l fl]`
  - `[r fr]`
  - `[b fb]`
  - `current-iteration`

  If the supplied `fn` returns true, it will signal convergence and the
  optimizer will return. Returning false will continue.

  `:choose` is called at the final step of optimization with all 4 points and
  their fn values (see the first four arguments to `:converged?`), and returns
  the final choice.

  `:callback` receives all 5 arguments on every iteration.

  `:maxiter` Maximum number of iterations allowed for the minimizer. Defaults to
  1000.

  `:maxfun` Maximum number of times the function can be evaluated before exiting.
  Defaults to 1000.

  `:fn-tolerance` check that the minimal value of any of the checked points is
  within the maximum of f(a) or f(b).

  `:arg-tolerance` check that `a` and `b` are within this supplied absolute
  distance."
