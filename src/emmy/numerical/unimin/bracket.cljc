(defn bracket-min
  "Generates an interval `[lo, hi]` that is guaranteed to contain a minimum of the
  function `f`, along with a candidate point `[mid, (f mid)]` that the user can
  use to start a minimum search.

  Returns a dictionary of the form:

  {:lo `lower end of the bracket`
   :mid `candidate point`
   :hi `upper end of the bracket`
   :fncalls `# of fn evaluations so far`
   :iterations `total iterations`}

  `:lo`, `:mid` and `:hi` are each pairs of the form `[x, (f x)]`.

  The implementation works by growing the bounds using either:

  - a step outside the bounds that places one bound at the golden-ratio cut
  point between the new bounds, or
  - a parabola with a minimum interpolated outside the current bounds, bounded b
  a max.

  This implementation was ported from `scipy.optimize.optimize.bracket`:
  https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/v1.5.2/scipy/optimize/optimize.py#L2450

  `bracket-min` supports the following optional keyword arguments:

  `:xa` the initial guess for the lower end of the bracket. Defaults to 0.0.

  `:xb` the initial guess for the upper end of the bracket. Defaults to 1.0. (If
  these points aren't supplied in sorted order they'll be switched.)

  `:grow-limit` The maximum factor that the parabolic interpolation can jump the
  function. Defaults to 110.0.

  `:maxiter` Maximum number of iterations allowed for the minimizer. Defaults to
  1000.

  `:maxfun` Maximum number of times the function can be evaluated before exiting.
  Defaults to 1000.
