;; ## Rational Functions
;;
;; This namespace contains an implementation of rational functions, or rational
;; fractions; the data structure wraps a numerator `u` and denominator `v` where
;; either or both are instances of [[p/Polynomial]]. (If both become
;; non-polynomial, the functions in this namespace drop the [[RationalFunction]]
;; instance down to whatever type is produced by `(g/divide u v)`).
;;
;; The [[RationalFunction]] type wraps up `u` and `v`, the `arity` of the
;; rational function (which must match the arity of `u` and `v`) and optional
;; metadata `m`.

  unwrapped expression built out of Clojure data structures.

  Returns the result of calling continuation `cont` with
  the [[RationalFunction]] and the list of variables corresponding to each
  indeterminate in the [[RationalFunction]]. (`cont `defaults to `vector`).

  The second optional argument `v-compare` allows you to provide a Comparator
  between variables. Sorting indeterminates by `v-compare` will determine the
  order of the indeterminates in the generated [[RationalFunction]]. The list of
  variables passed to `cont` will be sorted using `v-compare`.

  Absorbing an expression with [[expression->]] and emitting it again
  with [[->expression]] will generate the canonical form of an expression, with
  respect to the operations in the [[operators-known]] set.

  This kind of simplification proceeds purely symbolically over the known
  Rational Function operations; other operations outside the arithmetic
  available should be factored out by an expression
  analyzer (see [[emmy.expression.analyze/make-analyzer]]) before
  calling [[expression->]].

  NOTE that `cont` might receive a scalar, fraction or [[polynomial/Polynomial]]
  instance; both are valid 'rational functions'. The latter as a rational
  function with a denominator equal to `1`, and the former 2 result from
  non-polynomial numerator and denominator.
