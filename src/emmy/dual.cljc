;; ## Dual Numbers and Automatic Differentiation
;;
;; This namespace develops an implementation a ["dual
;; number"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number).
;;
;; As we'll discuss, passing dual numbers as arguments to some function $f$
;; built out of the [[emmy.generic]] operators allows us to build up the
;; _derivative_ of $f$ in parallel to our evaluation of $f$. Complex programs
;; are built out of simple pieces that we know how to evaluate; we can build up
;; derivatives of entire programs in a similar way by building them out of the
;; derivatives of the smaller pieces of those programs.
;;
;; ### Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation
;;
;; For many scientific computing applications, it's valuable to be able to
;; generate a "derivative" of a function; given some tiny increment in the
;; inputs, what tiny increment will the function produce in the output values?
;;
;; we know how to take derivatives of many of the generic functions exposed by
;; Emmy, like [[emmy.generic/+]], [[emmy.generic/*]], [[emmy.generic/sin]] and
;; friends. It turns out that we can take the derivatives of large, complicated
;; functions by combining the derivatives of these smaller functions using
;; the [chain
;; rule]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#The_chain_rule,_forward_and_reverse_accumulation))
;; as a clever bookkeeping device.
;;
;; NOTE the two flavors are forward and reverse mode. First we'll do forward,
;; then reverse.
;;
;; The technique of evaluating a function and its derivative in parallel is
;; called "forward-mode [Automatic
;; Differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation)".
;; The [Emmy
;; wiki](https://github.com/mentat-collective/emmy/wiki/Automatic-Differentiation)
;; has more information on the history of this technique, and links to the many
;; other implementations you'll find in different languages. See the [cljdocs
;; Automatic Differentiation
;; page](https://cljdoc.org/d/org.mentat/emmy/CURRENT/doc/calculus/automatic-differentiation)
;; for "how do I use this?"-style questions.
;;
;;
;; ### Dual Numbers and AD
;;
;; Our goal is to build up derivatives of complex functions out of the
;; derivatives of small pieces. A [dual
;; number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) is a relatively simple
;; piece of machinery that will help us accomplish this goal.

;; A [dual number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number) is a pair of
;; numbers of the form
;;
;; $$a + b \varepsilon$$
;;
;; where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $\varepsilon$ is an abstract thing,
;; with the property that $\varepsilon^2 = 0$.

;; > NOTE: This might remind you of the definition of a complex number of the
;; > form $a + bi$, where $i$ is also a new thing with the property that $i^2 =
;; > -1$. You are very wise! The bigger idea lurking here is the ["generalized
;; > complex
;; > number"](https://people.rit.edu/harkin/research/articles/generalized_complex_numbers.pdf).
;;
;; Why are dual numbers useful (in Emmy)? If you pass $a+b\varepsilon$ in
;; to a function $f$, the result is a dual number $f(a) + Df(a) b \varepsilon$;
;; the result contains both the function evaluation and the derivative
;; evaluation at $a$!

;; To see why, look at what happens when you pass a dual number into the [Taylor
;; series expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) of some
;; arbitrary function $f$. As a reminder, the Taylor series expansion of $f$
;; around some point $a$ is:
;;
;; $$f(x) = f(a)+\frac{Df(a)}{1!}(x-a)+\frac{D^2f(a)}{2!}(x-a)^{2}+\frac{D^3f(a)}{3!}(x-a)^{3}+\cdots$$
;;
;; > NOTE: See this nice overview of [Taylor series
;; > expansion](https://medium.com/@andrew.chamberlain/an-easy-way-to-remember-the-taylor-series-expansion-a7c3f9101063)
;; > by Andrew Chamberlain if you want to understand this idea and why we can
;; > approximate (smooth) functions this way.
;;
;; If you evaluate the expansion of $f(x)$ around $a$ with a dual number
;; argument whose first component is $a$ -- take $x=a+b\varepsilon$, for example
;; -- watch how the expansion simplifies:
;;
;; $$f(a+b\varepsilon) = f(a)+\frac{Df(a)}{1!}(b\varepsilon)+\frac{D^2f(a)}{2!}(b\varepsilon)^2+\cdots$$
;;
;; Since $\varepsilon^2=0$ we can ignore all terms beyond the first two:
;;
;; $$f(a+b\varepsilon) = f(a)+ (Df(a)b)\varepsilon$$
;;
;; > NOTE: See [[emmy.tape/lift-1]] for an implementation of this idea.
;;
;; This justifies our claim above: applying a function to some dual number
;; $a+\varepsilon$ returns a new dual number, where
;;
;; - the first component is $f(a)$, the normal function evaluation
;; - the second component is $Df(a)$, the derivative.
;;
;; If we do this twice, the second component of the returned dual number
;; beautifully recreates the [Chain
;; Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule):
;;
;; $$
;; \begin{aligned}
;; g(f(a+\varepsilon)) &= g(f(a) + Df(a)\varepsilon) \\
;; &= g(f(a)) + (Dg(f(a)))(Df(a))\varepsilon
;; \end{aligned}
;; $$
;;
;; ### Terminology Change
;;
;; A "dual number" is a very general idea. Because we're interested in dual
;; numbers as a bookkeeping device for derivatives, we're going to specialize
;; our terminology. From now on, we'll rename $a$ and $b$ to $x$ and $x'$. Given
;; a dual number of the form $x+x'\varepsilon$: we'll refer to:
;;
;; - $x$ as the "primal" part of the dual number
;; - $x'$ as the "tangent" part
;; - $\varepsilon$ as the "tag"
;;
;; > NOTE: "primal" means $x$ is tracking the "primal", or "primary", part of
;; > the computation. "tangent" is a synonym for "derivative". "tag" is going to
;; > make more sense shortly, when we start talking about mixing together
;; > multiple $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$ from different computations.
;;
;; ### Binary Functions
;;
;; What about functions of more than one variable? We can use the same approach
;; by leaning on the [multivariable Taylor series
;; expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series#Taylor_series_in_several_variables).
;; Take $f(x, y)$ as a binary example. If we pass dual numbers in to the taylor
;; series expansion of $f$, the $\varepsilon$ multiplication rule will erase all
;; higher-order terms, leaving us with:
;;
;; $$f(x+x'\varepsilon, y+y'\varepsilon) = f(x,y) + \left[\partial_1 f(x,y)x' + \partial_2 f(x,y)y'\right]\varepsilon$$
;;
;; > NOTE: See [[lift-2]] for an implementation of this idea.
;;
;; This expansion generalizes for n-ary functions; every new argument $x_n +
;; x'_n\varepsilon$ contributes $\partial_n f(...)x'_n$ to the result.
;;
;; We can check this with the simple cases of addition, subtraction and
;; multiplication.
;;
;; The real parts of a dual number add commutatively, so we can rearrange the
;; components of a sum to get a new dual number:
;;
;; $$(x+x'\varepsilon)+(y+y'\varepsilon) == (x+y)+(x'+y')\varepsilon$$
;;
;; This matches the [sum
;; rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules#Differentiation_is_linear)
;; of differentiation, since the partials of $x + y$ with respect to either $x$
;; or $y$ both equal 1.
;;
;; Subtraction is almost identical and agrees with the [subtraction
;; rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules#Differentiation_is_linear):
;;
;; $$(x+x'\varepsilon)-(y+y'\varepsilon) == (x-y)+(x'-y')\varepsilon$$
;;
;; Multiplying out the components of two dual numbers again gives us a new dual
;; number, whose tangent component agrees with the [product
;; rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule):
;;
;; $$
;; \begin{aligned}
;; (x+ x'\varepsilon)*(y+y'\epsilon) &= xy+(xy')\varepsilon+(x'y)\varepsilon+(x'y')\epsilon^2 \\
;; &= xy+(xy'+x'y)\varepsilon
;; \end{aligned}
;; $$
;;
;; Stare at these smaller derivations and convince yourself that they agree with
;; the Taylor series expansion method for binary functions.
;;
;; The upshot is that, armed with these techniques, we can implement a
;; higher-order `derivative` function (almost!) as simply as this:

(comment
  (defn derivative [f]
    (fn [x]
      (extract-tangent
       (f (make-dual x 1))))))

;; As long as `f` is built out of functions that know how to apply themselves to
;; dual numbers, this will all Just Work.
;;
;; ### Multiple Variables, Nesting
;;
;; All of the examples above are about first-order derivatives. Taking
;; higher-order derivatives is, in theory, straightforward:

(comment
  (derivative
   (derivative f)))

;; But this guess hits a subtle problem with the implementation of forward-mode
;; AD. The double-call to `derivative` will expand out like so:

(comment
  (fn [x]
    (letfn [(inner-d [x]
              (extract-tangent
               (f (make-dual x 1))))]
      (extract-tangent
       (inner-d
        (make-dual x 1))))))

;; the `x` received by `inner-d` will ALREADY be a dual number $x+\varepsilon$!
;; This will cause two immediate problems:
;;
;; - `(make-dual x 1)` will return $(x+\varepsilon)+\varepsilon = x+2\varepsilon$,
;;    which is not what we we want

;; - The `extract-tangent` call inside `inner-d` will return the `Df(x)`
;;   component of the dual number... which, remember, is no longer a dual
;;   number! So the SECOND call to `extract-tangent` have nothing to extract,
;;   and can only sensibly return 0.
;;
;; The problem here is called "perturbation confusion", and is covered in great
;; detail in
;; ["Confusion of Tagged Perturbations in Forward Automatic Differentiation of
;; Higher-Order Functions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4892), by Manzyuk et
;; al. (2019).
;;
;; The solution is to introduce a new $\varepsilon$ for every level, and allow
;; different $\varepsilon$ instances to multiply without annihilating. Each
;; $\varepsilon$ is called a "tag". By allowing dual numbers to contain dual
;; numbers with different tags in the primal and tangent slots, and carefully
;; managing which tag stays at the top level, we can allow nested derivatives
;; like the one described above to work.
;;
;; This implies that `extract-tangent` needs to take a tag, to determine _which_
;; tangent to extract:

(comment
  (defn derivative [f]
    (let [tag (fresh-tag)]
      (fn [x]
        (-> (f (make-dual x 1 tag))
            (extract-tangent tag))))))

;; This is close to the final form you'll find
;; at [[derivative]].
;;
;; ### What Return Values are Allowed?
;;
;; Before we discuss the implementation of dual
;; numbers, [[emmy.tape/lift-1]], [[emmy.tape/lift-2]] and the rest of the
;; machinery that makes this all possible; what sorts of objects is `f` allowed
;; to return?
;;
;; The dual number approach is beautiful because we can bring to bear all sorts
;; of operations in Clojure that never even _see_ dual numbers. For example,
;; `square-and-cube` called with a dual number returns a PAIR of dual numbers:

(comment
  (defn square-and-cube [x]
    (let [x2 (g/square x)
          x3 (g/cube x)]
      [x2 x3])))

;; Vectors don't care what they contain! We want the derivative of
;; `square-and-cube` to also return a vector, whose entries represent the
;; derivative of _that entry_ with respect to the function's input.
;;
;; But this implies that [[extract-tangent]] from the example above needs to
;; know how to handle vectors and other collections; in the case of a vector `v`
;; by returning `(mapv extract-tangent v)`.
;;
;; What about higher-order functions?

(comment
  (defn offset-fn
    "Returns a function that takes a single-argument function `g`, and returns a new
  function like `g` that offsets its input by `offset`."
    [offset]
    (fn [g]
      (fn [x]
        (g (+ x offset))))))

;; `(derivative offset-fn)` here returns a function! Manzyuk et al. 2019 makes
;; the reasonable claim that, if `(offset-fn x)` returns a function,
;; then `(derivative offset-fn)` should treat `offset-fn` as a multi-argument
;; function with its first argument curried.
;;
;; Let's say `f` takes a number `x` and returns a function `g` that maps number
;; => number. `(((derivative f) x) y)` should act just like the partial
;; derivative of the equivalent multi-argument function, with respect to the
;; first argument:
;;
;;```clj
;;(((partial 0) f-flattened) x y)
;;```
;;
;; In other words, `(derivative offset-fn)` should act just like:

(comment
  (derivative
   (fn [offset] (g (+ x offset)))))

;; for some known `g` and `x`, but with the ability to store `(derivative
;; offset-fn)` and call it later with many different `g`.
;;

;;
;; All of this suggests that we need to make [[extract-tangent]] an open
;; function that other folks can extend for other container-like
;; types ([functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor), specifically).
;;
;; The [[IPerturbed]] protocol accomplishes this, along with two other functions
;; that we'll use later:

(defprotocol IPerturbed
  (replace-tag [this old-tag new-tag]
    "If `this` is perturbed, Returns a similar object with the perturbation
    modified by replacing any appearance of `old-tag` with `new-tag`. Else,
    return `this`.")

  (extract-tangent [this tag mode]
    "If `this` is perturbed, return the tangent component paired with the
    supplied tag. Else, returns `([[emmy.value/zero-like]] this)`.")

  (extract-id [this id]
    "Given an instance of [[Completed]] (or a container type with [[Completed]]
    instances at its leaves) and the `id` of an [[emmy.tape/TapeCell]], returns
    the partial derivative associated with that [[emmy.tape/TapeCell]]'s
    `id`.

    This function is an internal implementation detail of reverse-mode automatic
    differentiation."))

;; The [[Completed]] type wraps a map of [[emmy.tape/TapeCell]] `id` to its
;; associated partial derivative; we need the wrapper to distinguish between a
;; pass of [[emmy.tape/reverse-phase]] over an [[emmy.tape/TapeCell]] and a pass
;; over a map.
;;
;; I can't currently think of a way to hide this implementation detail!

(defrecord Completed [id->partial]
  IPerturbed
  ;; NOTE that it's a problem that `replace-tag` is called on [[Completed]]
  ;; instances now. In a future refactor I want `get` calls out of
  ;; a [[Completed]] map to occur before tag replacement needs to happen.
  (replace-tag [_ old new]
    (Completed.
     (replace-tag id->partial old new)))

  ;; This should never be called; it would be that a [[Completed]] instance has
  ;; escaped from a derivative call.
  (extract-tangent [_ _ _] (assert "Impossible!"))
  (extract-id [_ id] (get id->partial id 0)))

(def ^:const FORWARD-MODE ::forward)
(def ^:const REVERSE-MODE ::reverse)
(def ^:const REVERSE-EMPTY (->Completed {}))

;; These are here to handle cases where some collection type might see instances
;; of [[Completed]] and try and handle them during simplification.

(defmethod g/zero? [Completed] [_] false)
(defmethod g/one? [Completed] [_] false)
(defmethod g/identity? [Completed] [_] false)

;; `replace-tag` exists to handle subtle bugs that can arise in the case of
;; functional return values. See the "Amazing Bug" sections
;; in [[emmy.calculus.derivative-test]] for detailed examples on how this might
;; bite you.
;;
;; The default implementations are straightforward, and match the docstrings:

(extend-protocol IPerturbed
  nil
  (replace-tag [_ _ _] nil)
  (extract-id [_ _] 0)
  (extract-tangent [_ _ mode]
    (if (= mode FORWARD-MODE)
      0
      REVERSE-EMPTY))

  #?(:clj Object :cljs default)
  (replace-tag [this _ _] this)
  (extract-id [_ _] 0)
  (extract-tangent [this _ mode]
    (if (= mode FORWARD-MODE)
      (g/zero-like this)
      REVERSE-EMPTY)))

;; ## Dual Implementation
;;
;; We now have a template for how to implement `derivative`. What's left? We
;; need a dual number type that we can build and split back out into primal and
;; tangent components, given some tag. We'll call this type a [[Dual]].
;;
;; Since the only use of a tag is to distinguish each unnamed $\varepsilon_n$,
;; we'll assign a new, unique positive integer for each new tag:

(let [next-tag (atom -1)]
  (defn fresh-tag
    "Returns a new, unique tag for use by a perturbation in an automatic
  differentiation pass."
    []
    (swap! next-tag inc)))

;; A [[Dual]] will respond to [[emmy.value/kind]] with `::dual`. Because we
;; want [[Dual]] instances to work in any place that real numbers or
;; symbolic argument work, let's make `::dual` derive from
;; `::emmy.value/scalar`:

(derive ::dual ::v/scalar)

;; Now the actual type.

(declare compare equiv)

(deftype Dual [tag primal tangent]
  IPerturbed
  (replace-tag [this old new]
    (if (= old tag)
      (Dual. new primal tangent)
      this))

  (extract-tangent [_ t mode]
    (cond (not= mode FORWARD-MODE) REVERSE-EMPTY

;; ## Comparison, Control Flow
;;
;; Functions like `=`, `<` and friends don't have derivatives; instead, they're

;; functions, the [[Dual]] API exposes a number of methods for comparing
;; numbers on ONLY their finite parts.
;;
;; Why? If `x` is a [[Dual]] instance, `(< x 10)` needs to return true whenever
;; a non-[[Dual]] `x` would return true. To make this work, these operations
;; look only at the [[primal]].
;;
;; HOWEVER! [[g/one?]] and [[g/zero?]] are examples of Emmy functions that
;; are used to skip operations that we _want_ to happen, like multiplication.
;;
;; `(g/* x y)` will return `y` if `(g/one? x)` is true... but to propagate the
;; derivative through we need this multiplication to occur. The compromise is:
;;
;; - [[g/zero?]], [[g/one?]] and [[g/identity?]] return true only when
;;  [[tangent]] is zero and the [[primal]] is either [[g/one?]] or [[g/zero?]]
;;   respectively
;; - [[eq]] and [[compare-full]] similarly looks at [[primal]] and [[tangent]]
;;   in the [[Dual]] supplied to both sides

;; while:

;; - [[equiv]] and [[compare]] only examine the [[primal]] of either side.

  returns the derivative of `f` at `x` using forward-mode automatic
  differentiation.

  For numerical differentiation,
  see [[emmy.numerical.derivative/D-numeric]].

  `f` must be built out of generic operations that know how to handle [[Dual]]
  inputs in addition to any types that a normal `(f x)` call would present. This
  restriction does _not_ apply to operations like putting `x` into a container
  or destructuring; just primitive function calls."

;; ## Chain Rule and Lifted Functions
;;
;; For the rest of the story, please see the implementations
;; of [[emmy.tape/lift-1]] and [[emmy.tape/lift-2]]. These functions "lift", or
;; augment, unary or binary functions with the ability to handle [[Dual]]
;; instances in addition to whatever other types they previously supported.
;;
;; The [[dual?]] branches inside these functions are implementations of the
;; single and multivariable Taylor series expansion methods discussed at the
;; beginning of the namespace.

;; ## Generic Method Installation
;;
;; These generic methods don't need to be lifted, so live here alongside
;; the [[Dual]] type definition.
